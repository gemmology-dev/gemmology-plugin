# Physical Properties of Gemstones

Guidance on understanding and measuring the physical properties of coloured gemstones, essential for identification and practical applications in jewellery.

## Core Physical Properties

### Hardness (Mohs Scale)

Hardness measures resistance to scratching. Use the Mohs scale (1-10) as a relative comparison.

| Mohs | Reference Mineral | Common Gemstones |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 10 | Diamond | - |
| 9 | Corundum | Ruby, Sapphire |
| 8.5 | - | Chrysoberyl, Alexandrite |
| 8 | Topaz | Topaz, Spinel |
| 7.5 | - | Beryl (Emerald, Aquamarine), Zircon |
| 7 | Quartz | Tourmaline, Garnet, Amethyst |
| 6.5 | - | Peridot, Tanzanite, Spodumene |
| 6 | Feldspar | Moonstone, Labradorite, Opal |
| 5.5 | - | Lapis Lazuli |
| 5 | Apatite | Apatite |

**Practical applications**:
- Stones ≥7 suitable for everyday ring wear
- Stones 6-7 require protective settings
- Stones <6 better for earrings, pendants, brooches

**Testing notes**:
- Never scratch-test valuable stones
- Hardness can vary by crystal direction (differential hardness)
- Kyanite: 4-4.5 parallel to length, 6-7 perpendicular

### Specific Gravity (SG)

Specific gravity is the ratio of a gemstone's weight to the weight of an equal volume of water.

**Testing methods**:
1. **Hydrostatic weighing** - Most accurate for loose stones
2. **Heavy liquids** - Quick sorting (use with caution, many are toxic)

### Crystal Systems

Seven crystal systems determine optical behaviour and physical properties.

| System | Symmetry | Optical Character | Examples |
|--------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Cubic (Isometric) | Highest | Singly refractive | Spinel, Garnet, Diamond |
| Tetragonal | 4-fold axis | Doubly refractive (uniaxial) | Zircon |
| Hexagonal | 6-fold axis | Doubly refractive (uniaxial) | Beryl, Apatite |
| Trigonal | 3-fold axis | Doubly refractive (uniaxial) | Corundum, Tourmaline, Quartz |
| Orthorhombic | 3 unequal axes | Doubly refractive (biaxial) | Topaz, Peridot, Tanzanite |
| Monoclinic | 1 oblique axis | Doubly refractive (biaxial) | Spodumene, Orthoclase |
| Triclinic | No symmetry | Doubly refractive (biaxial) | Labradorite, Turquoise |

### Cleavage and Fracture

**Cleavage**: Tendency to break along crystal planes.

| Quality | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Perfect | Smooth, flat surfaces | Topaz (basal), Kunzite, Fluorite |
| Good | Distinct but less smooth | Spodumene, Feldspar |
| Poor/Indistinct | Rarely seen | Beryl, Corundum |
| None | No cleavage planes | Quartz, Garnet, Spinel |

**Fracture types**:
- **Conchoidal**: Shell-like curves (quartz, obsidian, glass)
- **Uneven/Irregular**: Rough surface (most gems)
- **Splintery**: Fibrous appearance (nephrite jade)
- **Hackly**: Jagged, sharp edges (native metals)

**Setting considerations**:
- Perfect cleavage stones (topaz, kunzite) require careful setting
- Avoid ultrasonic cleaners for stones with cleavage
- Bezel settings offer more protection than prongs

### Lustre

Surface appearance when light reflects.

| Lustre Type | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Adamantine | Brilliant, diamond-like | Zircon, Demantoid, Sphene |
| Vitreous | Glass-like (most common) | Corundum, Beryl, Quartz, Tourmaline |
| Resinous | Resin-like | Amber, some Garnets |
| Waxy | Wax-like | Turquoise, Jadeite |
| Silky | Fibrous sheen | Tiger's Eye, Satin Spar |
| Pearly | Pearl-like | Moonstone |
| Greasy | Oily appearance | Nephrite, some Serpentine |

### Tenacity

Resistance to breaking, crushing, bending.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Brittle | Breaks or powders easily | Most gemstones |
| Tough | Resists breaking | Nephrite jade, Jadeite |
| Sectile | Can be cut with knife | Amber |

**Toughness vs hardness**:
- Nephrite (H 6-6.5) is tougher than diamond (H 10)
- Jadeite exceptionally tough despite moderate hardness
- Important for carving and durability
