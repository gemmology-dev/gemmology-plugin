# Synthetic Detection Guide

Practical methods for identifying synthetic gemstones.

## Detection Overview

### Testing Hierarchy

1. **Visual/Loupe examination** - First line of defence
2. **Microscopy** - Inclusion study
3. **Standard instruments** - RI, SG, polariscope
4. **Advanced testing** - Spectroscopy, chemical analysis

### When to Suspect Synthetic

| Observation | Concern Level |
|-------------|---------------|
| Too clean (no inclusions) | High |
| Unusually low price | High |
| Perfect colour | Moderate |
| Unknown provenance | Moderate |
| Mass production | Moderate |

## Synthetic Ruby Detection

### Flame-Fusion (Verneuil)

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Curved striae | Diffused light, immersion | 10-40x |
| Gas bubbles | Darkfield | 10x |
| Colour banding | Polariscope | Variable |
| Too clean | General observation | Obvious |

**Curved striae tips**:
- Look with diffused transmitted light
- Rotate stone to find orientation
- Immersion in RI liquid helps
- May be very subtle

### Flux-Grown

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Flux veils | Darkfield microscopy | 10-40x |
| Platinum platelets | Reflected light | 10-20x |
| Twisted veils | Microscopy | 20x+ |
| "Rain" patterns | Microscopy | 20x+ |

**Platinum crystal tips**:
- Bright, metallic appearance
- Often triangular or hexagonal
- May be very small
- Diagnostic when present

### Hydrothermal

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Chevron growth | Polariscope/microscopy | Variable |
| Seed plate | Immersion | If visible |
| Angular zoning | Microscopy | 10-40x |
| Too clean | General observation | Obvious |

### Natural vs Synthetic Summary

| Feature | Natural Ruby | Synthetic Ruby |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Silk | Intact or partially dissolved | None (FF) or absent |
| Growth pattern | Angular, hexagonal | Curved (FF) or chevron (HT) |
| Inclusions | Varied crystals | Bubbles, flux, platinum |
| Fluorescence | Variable | Often very strong |
| Spectrum | Complete | Complete (same chemistry) |

## Synthetic Sapphire Detection

### Flame-Fusion (Verneuil)

Same features as ruby:
- Curved striae
- Gas bubbles
- Exceptionally clean
- Colour banding follows curves

**Blue sapphire specifics**:
- Look for curved colour bands
- No natural zoning (hexagonal)
- May lack natural iron absorption

### Flux-Grown

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Flux inclusions | Similar to ruby |
| Platinum crystals | Present if platinum crucible |
| "Venetian blind" effect | Parallel flux planes |

### Hydrothermal

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Chevron growth | Distinctive pattern |
| Seed plate | May be visible |
| "Breadcrumb" inclusions | Some producers |
| Nail-head spicules | Distinctive shape |

## Synthetic Emerald Detection

### Flux-Grown (Chatham, Gilson, etc.)

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Flux veils | Darkfield | 10-40x |
| Platinum crystals | Reflected light | 10-30x |
| Phenakite crystals | Microscopy | 20x+ |
| Twisted veils | Microscopy | 20x+ |
| Orange fluorescence | UV (some) | Variable |

**Flux fingerprints**:
- Look similar to natural fingerprints
- Associated with platinum
- Different texture from natural

### Hydrothermal (Biron, Regency, etc.)

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Chevron growth | Immersion, polariscope | Variable |
| Seed plate | Immersion | If visible |
| Nail-head spicules | Microscopy | 10-40x |
| Two-phase inclusions | Microscopy | May be present |
| "Breadcrumb" inclusions | Microscopy | Some types |

**Seed plate detection**:
- Often parallel to table
- Sharp planar boundary
- Different refractive index
- Colour change at boundary

### Natural vs Synthetic Comparison

| Feature | Natural Emerald | Synthetic Emerald |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Three-phase inclusions | Common (Colombian) | Very rare |
| Jardin | Typical | Often too clean |
| Specific inclusions | Origin-related | Platinum, flux, chevron |
| RI | 1.577-1.583 | Similar (slightly lower for some) |
| Fluorescence | Usually inert | May fluoresce red |
| Chelsea filter | Variable red | May show red |

## Synthetic Spinel Detection

### Flame-Fusion (Verneuil)

| Feature | How to Detect | Visibility |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Curved striae | Diffused light | 10-40x |
| Gas bubbles | Darkfield | 10x |
| ADR (strain) | Polariscope | Common |
| Bright fluorescence | UV lamp | Often strong |

**Critical indicator**: Synthetic flame-fusion spinel shows ADR (anomalous double refraction) in polariscope, while natural spinel is truly isotropic or shows only weak ADR.

### Cobalt Blue Synthetic Spinel

| Feature | Natural Blue Spinel | Synthetic Blue Spinel |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Colour cause | Fe or rare natural Co | Co²⁺ (cobalt added) |
| Fluorescence | Inert | Strong red |
| Spectrum | Fe bands | Cobalt triple band |
| ADR | Minimal | Often strong |

**Red fluorescence under UV = synthetic cobalt spinel**

## Synthetic Alexandrite Detection

### Czochralski (Pulled)

| Feature | How to Detect | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Too clean | Visual | Almost no inclusions |
| Curved striae | Immersion | Very subtle |
| Strong change | Observation | May be too perfect |
| Colour | Both lights | Check quality |

### Hydrothermal/Flux

| Feature | How to Detect | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Flux veils | Microscopy | If flux method |
| Chevron growth | Polariscope | If hydrothermal |
| Platinum | Microscopy | If flux |

### Colour-Change Corundum (simulant)

| Factor | Synthetic Alexandrite | Synthetic Colour-Change Sapphire |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Species | Chrysoberyl | Corundum |
| RI | 1.746-1.755 | 1.762-1.770 |
| SG | 3.73 | 4.00 |
| Change | Green ↔ Red | Blue ↔ Purple (different) |

## Synthetic Diamond Notes

While focusing on coloured stones, note:
- HPHT synthetics: May have flux inclusions, unusual growth
- CVD synthetics: May have strain patterns
- Lab detection essential for valuable stones
