# Gem Testing Procedures

Standard testing protocols for gemstone identification.

## Systematic Testing Approach

### Order of Non-Destructive Tests

1. **Visual examination** (unaided eye)
2. **10x loupe examination**
3. **Microscopy**
4. **Refractometer**
5. **Polariscope**
6. **Dichroscope**
7. **Spectroscope**
8. **UV fluorescence**
9. **Specific gravity** (if needed)
10. **Advanced tests** (if needed)

### Test Selection by Stone Type

| Stone Type | Essential Tests | Secondary Tests |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Faceted transparent | RI, polariscope, spectrum | Microscope, UV, SG |
| Cabochon | RI (spot), microscope, UV | SG, phenomenon assessment |
| Opaque | SG, microscope, structure | Hardness (careful), streak |
| Organic | SG, reaction tests, structure | Microscope, UV |

## Visual Examination

### Unaided Eye Observations

| Observation | Record |
|-------------|--------|
| Colour | Hue, tone, saturation |
| Transparency | Transparent, translucent, opaque |
| Lustre | Vitreous, adamantine, waxy, etc. |
| Phenomena | Star, cat's eye, adularescence, etc. |
| Cut quality | Symmetry, proportions, finish |
| Damage | Chips, scratches, abrasions |

### 10x Loupe Examination

| Feature | Look For |
|---------|----------|
| Inclusions | Type, pattern, distribution |
| Surface features | Blemishes, polish quality |
| Facet junctions | Doubling indication |
| Girdle | Condition, treatment signs |
| Pavilion | Fractures, inclusions near surface |

## Refractometer Procedure

### Standard Method (Faceted Stones)

1. **Preparation**
   - Clean stone and refractometer
   - Apply small drop of RI liquid
   - Position stone flat facet down

2. **Reading**
   - Look through eyepiece
   - Locate shadow edge on scale
   - Rotate stone 180° for second reading
   - Record both readings

3. **Birefringence Calculation**
   - BR = Higher RI - Lower RI
   - Record to 3 decimal places

### Spot Method (Cabochons)

1. Apply small RI liquid drop
2. Touch curved surface to glass
3. Look for shadow edge or spot
4. May need multiple positions

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No reading | RI too high | Use higher index liquid |
| Blurry edge | Dirty glass or stone | Clean thoroughly |
| Moving edge | Stone not flat | Reposition |
| Two edges | Birefringent | Normal - record both |

### RI Liquid Selection

| Liquid RI | Use For | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1.74 | Standard testing | Methylene iodide |
| 1.76 | Standard testing | Clove oil saturated |
| 1.79 | High RI stones | Bromoform mixture |
| 1.81 | High RI stones | Special formulations |

## Polariscope Procedure

### Setting Up

1. Turn on lower polariser (fixed)
2. Place stone between polarisers
3. Turn on upper polariser (rotatable)
4. Set to extinction position (dark field)

### Testing Steps

1. **Initial observation**
   - Place stone in dark field
   - Note if stone is light or dark

2. **360° rotation**
   - Rotate upper polariser slowly
   - Count number of brightness changes
   - Note pattern of light/dark

3. **Interpretation**

| Observation | Indicates |
|-------------|-----------|
| Stays dark | Isotropic (SR) or optic axis |
| 4 light/dark cycles | Anisotropic (DR) |
| Wavy light patches | ADR or aggregate |
| Interference figure | Confirms anisotropic |

### Interference Figures

**Uniaxial**:
- Maltese cross pattern
- Concentric colour rings
- Indicates tetragonal/hexagonal/trigonal

**Biaxial**:
- Two separated brushes
- Curved isogyres
- Indicates orthorhombic/monoclinic/triclinic

### Conoscope Attachment

1. Insert conoscope lens
2. Look down optic axis
3. View interference figure
4. Determine optic sign

## Dichroscope Procedure

### Calcite Dichroscope

1. **Preparation**
   - Hold dichroscope to eye
   - View through two windows
   - Align with good light source

2. **Testing**
   - Look through coloured portion of stone
   - Compare two windows
   - Rotate stone 90°
   - Note colour differences

3. **Interpretation**

| Observation | Indicates |
|-------------|-----------|
| Same colour both windows | No pleochroism (isotropic or weak DR) |
| Two different colours | Dichroic (uniaxial) |
| Check multiple directions | May find third colour (biaxial) |

### Recording Pleochroism

| Strength | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| None | Same in all directions |
| Weak | Barely perceptible difference |
| Moderate | Clear colour difference |
| Strong | Distinctly different colours |
| Very strong | Dramatically different |

## Spectroscope Procedure

### Prism Spectroscope

1. **Setup**
   - Adjust slit width for sharpness
   - Use strong transmitted or reflected light
   - Position stone between light and slit

2. **Viewing**
   - Look through eyepiece
   - Note absorption bands/lines
   - Scan entire visible spectrum (400-700nm)
   - Record positions

3. **Light Sources**
   - Incandescent: Good continuous spectrum
   - Fibre-optic: Concentrated, flexible
   - Daylight: Natural but variable

### Diffraction Grating Spectroscope

- More even spectrum display
- Easier wavelength estimation
- May show less detail than prism

### Recording Spectra

| Record | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Band position | Estimate wavelength (nm) |
| Band width | Sharp line vs broad band |
| Intensity | Strong, moderate, weak |
| Pattern | Complete description |

## UV Fluorescence Procedure

### Equipment Setup

1. Ensure dark room
2. Warm up lamps (5-10 minutes)
3. Have both LW (365nm) and SW (254nm) ready
4. Use neutral background

### Testing Steps

1. **Long-wave first** (safer)
   - Place stone under LW lamp
   - Note colour and intensity
   - Check for phosphorescence after

2. **Short-wave second**
   - Place stone under SW lamp
   - Note colour and intensity
   - Compare to LW reaction

3. **Phosphorescence check**
   - Turn off UV
   - Observe for afterglow
   - Note duration

### Safety Precautions

- Never look directly at UV source
- Especially careful with SW UV
- Use protective eyewear
- Limit exposure time
- Keep skin covered

### Recording Fluorescence

| Factor | Record |
|--------|--------|
| LW colour | Blue, green, red, orange, etc. |
| LW intensity | Inert, weak, moderate, strong, very strong |
| SW colour | May differ from LW |
| SW intensity | May differ from LW |
| Phosphorescence | Colour, duration |

## Specific Gravity Procedure

### Hydrostatic Weighing

1. **Weigh in air**
   - Dry, clean stone
   - Record weight (W₁)

2. **Weigh in water**
   - Submerge in distilled water
   - Ensure no air bubbles
   - Record weight (W₂)

3. **Calculate SG**
   - SG = W₁ ÷ (W₁ - W₂)
   - Adjust for water temperature if needed

### Heavy Liquids (Reference)

| Liquid | SG | Use |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Bromoform | 2.89 | Quartz will float |
| Methylene iodide | 3.32 | Many gems sink |
| Clerici solution | 4.25 | Most gems float (toxic) |

**Note**: Heavy liquids are toxic and increasingly restricted

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Prevention |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Bubbles on stone | Not wetted properly | Use wetting agent |
| Wire weight | Bridge moves | Consistent setup |
| Temperature variation | Water temp changes | Thermometer, corrections |
| Stone mounted | Metal affects weight | Estimate or remove |

## Microscope Procedure

### Standard Examination

1. **Low magnification first** (10x-20x)
   - Overall inclusion survey
   - Colour zoning patterns
   - Growth features

2. **Higher magnification** (30x-60x)
   - Specific inclusion identification
   - Surface features
   - Fine detail

3. **Lighting techniques**

| Lighting | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| Darkfield | Inclusions, fingerprints |
| Brightfield | Surface features |
| Fibre-optic | Directional lighting, silk |
| Polarised | Strain patterns |
| Immersion | Curved striae, internal features |

### Immersion Microscopy

1. Choose appropriate liquid (RI close to stone)
2. Place stone in immersion cell
3. Reduces surface reflections
4. Reveals internal features

### Documentation

- Photograph significant features
- Note inclusion types and patterns
- Map inclusion locations
- Record magnification used
