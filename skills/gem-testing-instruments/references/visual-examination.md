## Image Interpretation Guidelines

When interpreting photographs of gemstones for identification or quiz/exam purposes:

### Pre-Answer Checklist

1. **Take a screenshot** of any image-based question
2. **Identify the specific feature** being asked about
3. **List possible interpretations** before selecting
4. **Ask user for confirmation** if uncertain
5. **Describe observations** explicitly

### Commonly Confused Visual Features

| Feature | Appearance | Common Misidentification |
|---------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Asterism** | 4, 6, or 12-rayed star pattern | Chatoyancy, colour zoning |
| **Chatoyancy (Cat's eye)** | Single band of light | Asterism, stress cracks |
| **Stress cracks** | Internal fractures, often iridescent | Chatoyancy, inclusions |
| **Straight colour zoning** | Parallel colour bands | Growth patterns, curved zoning |
| **Curved colour zoning** | Curved colour bands | Straight zoning (diagnostic for flame-fusion synthetics) |
| **Silk** | Fine needle-like inclusions | Stress cracks, chatoyancy |

### Distinguishing Key Features

#### Asterism vs Chatoyancy
- **Asterism**: Multiple rays (star) from intersecting needle sets
- **Chatoyancy**: Single band from parallel needles in one direction

#### Stress Cracks vs Chatoyancy
- **Stress cracks**: Irregular, often shows iridescence, internal fractures
- **Chatoyancy**: Smooth, moves across stone as light moves, from silk inclusions

#### Straight vs Curved Colour Zoning
- **Straight zoning**: Natural corundum - parallel to crystal faces
- **Curved zoning**: Flame-fusion synthetic - follows boule curvature

### Transparency Assessment

| Term | Definition | Light Transmission |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Transparent** | Objects clearly visible through stone | Full transmission |
| **Translucent** | Light passes but objects blurred | Partial transmission |
| **Opaque** | No light transmission | No transmission |

Common stones by transparency:
- **Transparent**: Diamond, corundum, beryl, topaz
- **Translucent**: Moonstone, chalcedony, jadeite
- **Opaque**: Malachite, lapis lazuli, turquoise

### Lighting Effects on Appearance

| Lighting Type | Best For Observing |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Top illumination** | Lustre, surface features |
| **Dark-field** | Internal inclusions |
| **Bright-field** | Colour zoning, transparency |
| **Fibre optic** | Silk, asterism, chatoyancy |
| **Polarised** | Strain, twinning |

### When to Ask User for Confirmation

Always seek user confirmation when:
- Image quality is poor or ambiguous
- Multiple interpretations seem plausible
- The feature is subtle or partially visible
- Lighting in the photo may be misleading
- The stone's orientation is unclear

### Example Confirmation Request

> "In this image, I observe [describe feature]. This could be interpreted as:
> 1. [Option A] because [reasoning]
> 2. [Option B] because [reasoning]
>
> Based on [specific visual cue], I believe it's most likely [choice], but please confirm if you can see [distinguishing feature] more clearly."
