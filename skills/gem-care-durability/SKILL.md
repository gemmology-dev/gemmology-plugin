# Gemstone Care and Durability

Guidance on caring for coloured gemstones, understanding durability factors, and recommending appropriate use in jewellery.

## Durability Factors

Gemstone durability depends on three factors:

### 1. Hardness (Scratch Resistance)

Mohs scale measures resistance to scratching.

| Hardness | Everyday Wear | Ring Use |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| 9 (Corundum) | Excellent | Excellent |
| 8-8.5 (Topaz, Chrysoberyl, Spinel) | Very good | Excellent |
| 7-7.5 (Quartz, Tourmaline, Garnet, Beryl) | Good | Good with care |
| 6-6.5 (Feldspar, Opal, Tanzanite) | Fair | Protective setting |
| <6 (Apatite, Fluorite) | Poor | Not recommended for rings |

**Reference**: Common dust (quartz, silica) is hardness 7. Gems below 7 can be scratched by everyday dust.

### 2. Toughness (Resistance to Breaking)

| Toughness | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Exceptional | Very resistant to breaking | Nephrite jade, Jadeite |
| Good | Resistant to normal wear | Ruby, Sapphire, Spinel |
| Fair | Can chip or crack with impact | Topaz, Emerald, Opal |
| Poor | Fragile, chips easily | Tanzanite, Kunzite |

**Note**: Hardness ≠ Toughness. Diamond is hardest but has perfect cleavage.

### 3. Stability (Resistance to Light, Heat, Chemicals)

| Factor | Sensitive Gems |
|--------|----------------|
| Light | Kunzite, Amethyst (fading), some tourmaline |
| Heat | Opal, Tanzanite, Emerald (filled), Glass-filled ruby |
| Chemicals | Filled gems, Pearls, Coral, Turquoise |

## Care by Gemstone

### Corundum (Ruby & Sapphire)

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 9 - Excellent |
| Toughness | Good |
| Stability | Excellent (untreated) |

**Care**:
- Safe for ultrasonic (if untreated/heat-only)
- Safe for steam cleaning (if untreated/heat-only)
- **Caution with filled stones**: Avoid ultrasonic, steam, chemicals

**Filled ruby care**:
- NO ultrasonic
- NO steam
- Avoid acids (even lemon juice)
- Avoid sudden temperature changes
- Glass filling can deteriorate

### Emerald

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 7.5-8 |
| Toughness | Poor to Fair (often fractured) |
| Stability | Moderate (oil can dry out) |

**Care**:
- **NO ultrasonic** - can damage fillings and inclusions
- **NO steam** - can remove oil, damage stone
- Clean with mild soap and soft brush only
- Avoid sudden temperature changes
- Re-oiling may be needed over time
- Store separately (avoid scratches)

### Opal

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 5.5-6.5 |
| Toughness | Poor |
| Stability | Poor (can craze/crack) |

**Care**:
- NO ultrasonic
- NO steam
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Avoid dry environments (can craze)
- Some recommend occasional water exposure
- Ethiopian opal is hydrophane (absorbs water)
- Keep away from oils and chemicals

**Storage**: In padded box, away from heat sources

### Tanzanite

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 6-7 |
| Toughness | Poor (perfect cleavage) |
| Stability | Poor (heat sensitive) |

**Care**:
- NO ultrasonic
- NO steam
- Avoid sudden temperature changes
- Handle with care (cleavage)
- Best for earrings, pendants (less exposure to knocks)
- Protective settings for rings

### Topaz

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 8 |
| Toughness | Poor (perfect basal cleavage) |
| Stability | Good |

**Care**:
- Ultrasonic generally safe
- Steam generally safe
- **Avoid hard knocks** - can cleave
- Blue topaz is stable
- Imperial topaz: avoid prolonged light exposure

### Tourmaline

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 7-7.5 |
| Toughness | Fair |
| Stability | Good |

**Care**:
- Ultrasonic: Use with caution (may have inclusions)
- Steam: Avoid (heat sensitive varieties)
- Clean with warm soapy water
- Paraiba tourmaline may be treated (check)

### Spinel

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 8 |
| Toughness | Good |
| Stability | Excellent |

**Care**:
- Ultrasonic: Safe
- Steam: Safe
- Very durable gemstone
- Minimal care concerns

### Peridot

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 6.5-7 |
| Toughness | Fair to Poor |
| Stability | Fair (acid sensitive) |

**Care**:
- NO ultrasonic (fractures easily)
- NO steam
- Avoid acids
- Clean with mild soap and soft brush
- Protective settings recommended

### Garnet

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 6.5-7.5 |
| Toughness | Fair to Good |
| Stability | Good |

**Care**:

- Steam: Safe for most
- Demantoid: More fragile (avoid ultrasonic)

### Feldspar (Moonstone, Labradorite, Sunstone)

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Hardness | 6-6.5 |
| Toughness | Poor (two cleavage directions) |
| Stability | Good |

## Storage Recommendations

### General Rules

1. **Separate gems by hardness** - harder stones scratch softer ones
2. **Individual pouches or compartments** - prevent contact
3. **Padded boxes** - protect from knocks
4. **Away from heat and sunlight** - prevents fading/damage
5. **Moderate humidity** - especially for opals
6. **Secure from theft** - insurance considerations

### Special Storage Needs

| Gem | Special Requirement |
|-----|---------------------|
| Opal | Moderate humidity, padded |
| Pearls | Away from perfume/chemicals |
| Emerald | Avoid very dry conditions |
| Kunzite | Away from light (fading) |

## Setting Recommendations

### Ring Settings by Durability

| Durability | Recommended Settings |
|------------|---------------------|
| High (H 8+, good toughness) | Any setting, solitaire OK |
| Medium (H 7-8) | Bezel, protective settings |
| Low (H <7 or fragile) | Bezel, recessed, occasional wear only |

### Protective Settings

| Setting | Protection Level |
|---------|------------------|
| Bezel | High - surrounds entire girdle |
| Half-bezel | Medium |
| Flush/Gypsy | High - stone set into metal |
| Prong/Claw | Low - stone exposed |
