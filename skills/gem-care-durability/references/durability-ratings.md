# Gemstone Durability Ratings

Comprehensive durability assessment for gemstone selection and care.

## Understanding Durability

### The Three Factors

| Factor | Definition | Test |
|--------|------------|------|
| **Hardness** | Resistance to scratching | Mohs scale |
| **Toughness** | Resistance to breaking/chipping | Relative scale |
| **Stability** | Resistance to chemicals, heat, light | Specific tests |

### Durability ≠ Hardness

A gem can be:
- Hard but brittle (topaz: H8, perfect cleavage)
- Soft but tough (nephrite: H6, extremely tough)
- Hard and tough (corundum: H9, no cleavage)

## Durability Categories

### Excellent Durability

Suitable for all jewellery, including daily-wear rings.

| Gemstone | Hardness | Toughness | Stability | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Corundum (ruby, sapphire) | 9 | Excellent | Excellent | Ideal for any use |
| Chrysoberyl | 8.5 | Good | Excellent | Cat's eye, alexandrite |
| Spinel | 8 | Good | Excellent | No cleavage |

### Very Good Durability

Suitable for most jewellery with normal care.

| Gemstone | Hardness | Toughness | Stability | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|

| Moonstone | 6-6.5 | Poor | Good | Cleavage planes |
| Kunzite | 6.5-7 | Poor | Fair | Cleavage + fading |
| Apatite | 5 | Fair | Fair | Soft |
| Sphene | 5-5.5 | Poor | Fair | Soft, brittle |

### Low Durability

Best for earrings, pendants, brooches, or collectors.

| Gemstone | Hardness | Toughness | Stability | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Fluorite | 4 | Poor | Fair | Soft, perfect cleavage |
| Rhodochrosite | 3.5-4 | Poor | Poor | Very soft |
| Calcite | 3 | Poor | Poor | Very soft, cleaves |
| Pearl | 2.5-4.5 | Fair | Poor | Organic, sensitive |
| Amber | 2-2.5 | Poor | Poor | Organic, soft |

## Detailed Factor Analysis

### Toughness Scale

| Rating | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Exceptional | Nearly unbreakable | Nephrite jade |
| Excellent | Very chip-resistant | Corundum, jadeite |
| Good | Chip-resistant | Spinel, quartz, tourmaline |
| Fair | Moderate chip risk | Beryl, topaz (non-cleavage) |
| Poor | Chips/breaks easily | Topaz (cleavage), tanzanite |

### Cleavage Impact

| Cleavage Type | Durability Impact | Examples |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| None | Positive | Tourmaline, garnet, spinel |
| Indistinct | Minimal | Beryl, peridot |
| Distinct | Moderate | Chrysoberyl |
| Good | Significant | Moonstone |
| Perfect | Major | Topaz, tanzanite, kunzite |
| Perfect in multiple directions | Severe | Fluorite |

### Stability Factors

#### Heat Sensitivity

| Sensitivity | Gemstones | Concern |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Very sensitive | Opal, tanzanite, amber | Avoid heat entirely |
| Sensitive | Emerald (treated), kunzite | No jeweller's torch |
| Moderate | Most gems | Normal caution |
| Stable | Corundum, chrysoberyl, spinel | Heat tolerant |

#### Light Sensitivity

| Sensitivity | Gemstones | Concern |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Highly sensitive | Kunzite, Maxixe beryl | Fades in sunlight |
| Moderately sensitive | Amethyst, rose quartz | Extended UV exposure |
| Slightly sensitive | Citrine, smoky quartz | Prolonged strong light |
| Stable | Most other gems | Normal exposure OK |

#### Chemical Sensitivity

| Sensitivity | Gemstones | Avoid |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Very sensitive | Pearl, coral, amber | Acids, perfumes, hairspray |
| Sensitive | Opal, turquoise, malachite | Chemicals, oils |
| Moderate | Emerald (treated) | Solvents, ultrasonics |
| Resistant | Corundum, spinel, quartz | Standard cleaners OK |
