# Treatment Disclosure Requirements

Industry standards and legal requirements for gemstone treatment disclosure.

## Fundamental Principles

### General Rule

**All treatments must be disclosed at the point of sale**

Exceptions:
- Minor treatments considered normal for the species (minor oiling of emeralds)
- But even "standard" treatments should be disclosed upon request

### Levels of Disclosure

| Level | What's Disclosed | When Required |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Full | Treatment type, degree, permanence | Always recommended |
| Standard | Treatment status (treated/untreated) | Minimum legal requirement |
| Upon request | Additional details | When customer asks |
