## Detailed Stability Information

### Heat Treatment

#### Corundum (Ruby and Sapphire)

| Treatment Type | Stability | Reversion Risk |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Simple heating | Permanent | None |
| Flux healing | Permanent | None (but filled) |
| With titanium | Permanent | None |
| Beryllium diffusion | Permanent | None |

**Care considerations**:
- Normal jeweller's torch: Safe for simple heated
- Avoid extreme temperatures on flux-healed
- Inform jewellers before repair

#### Tanzanite

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Normal wear | Colour stable |
| Heat (jeweller's torch) | May shift colour |
| Prolonged high heat | Risk of colour change |

**Recommendation**: Remove from setting before any heat work

#### Zircon

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Normal wear | Colour stable |
| Strong light | Generally stable |
| UV exposure | Blue usually stable |

**Some brown zircons**: May revert to original colour with strong UV

### Filling Treatments

#### Emerald Oil and Resin

| Filler Type | Stability | Maintenance |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Natural oil (cedarwood) | Moderate | May need re-oiling |
| Synthetic oil | Good | Less maintenance |
| Resin (Opticon etc.) | Good | Avoid heat/solvents |
| Polymer (Permasafe) | Very good | More stable |

**Degradation factors**:
| Factor | Risk Level | Prevention |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Heat | High | No ultrasonic, steam |
| Solvents | High | No chemical cleaners |
| Time | Moderate | Store properly |
| Light | Low | Normal exposure OK |
| Physical wear | Low | Protective settings |

**Re-oiling**: Professional service available; indicates previous treatment

#### Lead-Glass Filled Ruby

| Factor | Risk | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Acids | Very high | Lemon juice, vinegar damage |
| Heat | Very high | No torch, ultrasonic, steam |
| Ultrasonic | High | Can damage filling |
| Chemicals | High | Cleaning products |
| Time | Moderate | Glass may degrade |
| Physical | Moderate | Filled areas weaker |

**Critical warnings**:
- Household acids dissolve filling
- Jeweller repairs can destroy stone
- Not suitable for rings (durability)
- Significant care required

### Coating Treatments

| Coating Type | Durability | Weakness |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| Thin film (topaz) | Low-moderate | Scratches, wear |
| Colour coating | Low | Scratches, solvents |
| Wax/oil surface | Very low | Heat, wear, time |

**Expected lifespan**:
- Thin film: Years with care
- Colour coating: Variable, may wear
- Surface wax: Months to years

### Irradiation Treatments

#### Blue Topaz

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Normal light | Stable |
| Strong UV | Stable |
| Heat | Stable after initial setting |
| Time | Permanent |

**Note**: Considered permanent; industry-standard treatment

#### Coloured Diamonds

| Type | Stability | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| HPHT-treated | Permanent | Colour stable |
| Irradiated | Generally stable | Some may shift |
| Coated | Low | Not permanent |

#### Maxixe Beryl

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Daylight | Fades |
| Strong light | Fades quickly |
| Darkness | Stable (but reverts) |

**Warning**: Known unstable treatment; colour not permanent

#### Pink/Red Tourmaline

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Normal light | Generally stable |
| Strong UV | May fade some stones |
| Heat | May affect some |

### Diffusion Treatments

#### Beryllium Diffusion (Sapphire)

| Aspect | Stability |
|--------|-----------|
| Colour permanence | Permanent in lattice |
| Repolishing | Deep diffusion survives |
| Heat exposure | Stable |
| Normal wear | No concerns |

**Note**: Treatment is in crystal structure; cannot be reversed

#### Titanium Diffusion (Star Sapphires)

| Aspect | Stability |
|--------|-----------|
| Colour permanence | Surface only |
| Repolishing | Removes treatment |
| Heat | Stable |
| Wear | Surface may scratch |

### Bleaching and Impregnation

#### Jadeite (B-Jade)

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Time | Polymer may yellow |
| UV light | May degrade polymer |
| Chemicals | May damage filler |
| Physical | More fragile |

**Long-term**: Treatment may degrade; not considered permanent

#### Turquoise Stabilisation

| Treatment | Durability |
|-----------|------------|
| Wax | Low; wear, heat |
| Plastic | Moderate; generally stable |
| Zachery treatment | Good; more permanent |

## Care Recommendations by Treatment

### High-Durability Treatments

| Treatment | Safe | Avoid |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Simple heat (corundum) | Normal care | Extreme heat |

| Deep Be-diffusion | Normal care | Nothing specific |

### Moderate-Durability Treatments

| Treatment | Safe | Avoid |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Minor oiling (emerald) | Mild soap, water | Ultrasonic, steam, solvents |
| Resin fill (emerald) | Mild soap, water | Heat, ultrasonic, steam |
| Coating (general) | Gentle handling | Abrasives, chemicals |

### Low-Durability Treatments

| Treatment | Safe | Avoid |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Lead-glass filling | Damp cloth only | Everything else |
| Heavy oiling | Minimal contact | Heat, solvents, ultrasonic |
| Surface wax | Cool, dark storage | Heat, light, friction |

## Professional Considerations

### Before Jewellery Repair

| Information Needed | Why Important |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Treatment status | Heat may damage |
| Filling type | Torch work risks |
| Coating presence | May be destroyed |
| Diffusion type | Repolishing issues |

### Insurance and Appraisal

| Treatment | Disclosure | Value Impact |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Permanent heat | Always | Standard deduction |
| Filling | Critical | Significant impact |
| Coating | Critical | Major impact |
| Unstable treatments | Critical | Affects insurability |
