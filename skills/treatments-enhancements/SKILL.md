# Treatments and Enhancements

Guidance on gemstone treatments, detection methods, stability, and disclosure requirements. Understanding treatments is essential for accurate identification and ethical trade practice.

## Treatment Categories

### By Industry Acceptance

| Level | Treatment | Acceptance | Disclosure |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Traditional** | Heat (corundum), Oil (emerald) | Widely accepted | Required |
| **Accepted** | Waxing, Bleaching | Generally accepted | Required |
| **Controversial** | Diffusion, Filling | Less accepted | Mandatory, affects value |
| **Not accepted** | Undisclosed treatments | Trade violation | Mandatory |

## Heat Treatment

### Corundum (Ruby & Sapphire)

**Purpose**: Improve colour and clarity

**Types**:
| Type | Temperature | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Low-temp | 400-1000°C | Colour improvement |
| High-temp | 1200-1800°C | Dissolve silk, alter colour |
| With flux | Variable | Heal fractures |

**Detection Indicators**:

| Feature | Unheated | Heated |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Silk | Intact, sharp needles | Broken, dotted, dissolved |
| Colour zoning | Sharp boundaries | Diffused |
| Surface | Clean | Pitting, melt marks |
| Inclusions | Unaltered | Stress haloes, altered |
| Boehmite | Present | Dissolved |

**Laboratory Confirmation**:
- FTIR spectroscopy (3309cm⁻¹ peak changes)
- Microscopic examination
- Photoluminescence

### Tanzanite

Almost all tanzanite is heated:
- Natural colour: Brown to yellowish
- Heated colour: Blue to violet-blue
- Treatment considered permanent and stable
- Widely accepted in trade

### Aquamarine

Most aquamarine is heated:
- Removes greenish component (reduces Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺)
- Creates purer blue from blue-green
- Stable and permanent
- Detection often impossible
- Low-temperature treatment (<400°C)

**Disclosure practice**:
- Industry: Widely accepted, often not disclosed
- Major labs: May note "no indication of heating" if detectible
- Market: Heat treatment assumed for most commercial aquamarine
- Premium: Untreated "Santa Maria" quality commands some premium
- Natural green-blue beryl sometimes marketed as "aquamarine" before heating

**Note**: Unlike corundum where unheated commands significant premium, aquamarine heat treatment is so universal and undetectable that disclosure is rarely required in trade. However, representing heated aquamarine as "untreated" when specifically asked is unethical.

### Zircon

Blue zircon is heated:
- Natural zircon rarely blue
- Heat treatment creates blue, colourless
- Stable
- Assumed for blue zircon

### Topaz

Imperial topaz heating:
- Natural orange to pink
- Blue topaz: Always irradiated + heated
- London Blue requires more treatment than Swiss Blue

## Diffusion Treatment

### Surface (Lattice) Diffusion

**Titanium Diffusion** (Sapphire):
- Creates thin blue surface layer
- Colour concentrated at facet junctions
- Visible in immersion
- Must be disclosed

**Detection**:
- Immersion: Colour concentration at edges
- Facet re-cutting removes colour

### Beryllium Diffusion

**Deep diffusion** - more difficult to detect:
- Beryllium penetrates entire stone
- Creates yellow, orange, pink, padparadscha colours
- Some natural stones contain Be naturally

**Detection**:
- LA-ICP-MS required (Be analysis)
- Cannot be detected visually
- Laboratory testing essential

**Colours affected**:
- Yellow sapphires
- Orange sapphires
- Padparadscha-type colours
- Some pink sapphires

## Filling Treatments

### Lead Glass Filling (Ruby)

**Purpose**: Fill fractures, improve clarity dramatically

**Characteristics**:
- Can make heavily fractured ruby appear clean
- RI different from ruby (~1.55 vs 1.76)
- Visible under magnification

**Detection**:
| Feature | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| Flash effect | Blue/orange flash in fractures |
| Gas bubbles | Flattened bubbles in glass |
| Surface | Glass may be visible at surface |
| Durability | Glass can be damaged by chemicals |

**Care Issues**:
- Avoid acids (lemon juice, vinegar)
- Avoid heat
- Avoid ultrasonic cleaning
- Low durability

### Oil/Resin Treatment (Emerald)

**Almost universal** - assume all emeralds are treated unless certified otherwise.

**Types**:
| Material | RI | Detection | Stability |
|----------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Cedar oil | ~1.52 | UV fluorescence | Unstable |
| Canada balsam | ~1.54 | Drying visible | Moderate |
| Opticon | ~1.54 | UV, drying | Moderate |
| Gematrat | ~1.54 | Similar to emerald RI | More stable |
| ExCel | Higher | Designed to match RI | Most stable |

**Detection**:
- Microscopy: Filled fractures visible
- UV: Some oils fluoresce
- FTIR: Organic materials detected

**GIA Clarity Enhancement Grades**:
| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| None | No evidence of treatment |
| Insignificant (F1) | Minor treatment |
| Minor (F2) | Moderate treatment |
| Moderate | Notable treatment |
| Significant | Heavy treatment |

### Fracture Filling (Other Gems)

- Diamonds (not covered)
- Ruby (lead glass)
- Sapphire (glass/borax)
- Some tourmaline

## Irradiation

### Blue Topaz

All blue topaz is irradiated:
| Type | Colour | Treatment |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Sky Blue | Light blue | Light irradiation + heat |
| Swiss Blue | Medium blue | More irradiation |
| London Blue | Dark blue | Heavy irradiation |

**Safety**: Commercially sold stones are safe (residual radioactivity decayed)

### Other Irradiated Gems

| Gemstone | Effect | Stability |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Colourless topaz → Blue | Stable | Permanent |
| Colourless quartz → Smoky | Stable | Permanent |
| Light tourmaline → Darker | Variable | Usually stable |
| Yellow beryl → Blue | Variable | Can fade |
| Kunzite | Enhanced pink | Can fade |

## Coating

### Types

| Coating | Purpose | Detection |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Thin film (titanium) | Create colours | Iridescence, scratches |
| Paint/lacquer | Enhance colour | Visible at girdle |
| Foil backing | Improve brilliance | Visible in closed settings |

### Detection

- Examine girdle and pavilion
- Look for scratches revealing substrate
- Immersion testing
- Unusual surface lustre

### Stability

- Coatings wear off over time
- Cannot withstand jewellery wear
- Must be disclosed

## Surface Treatments

### Waxing

- Common for turquoise, lapis lazuli
- Improves polish and colour
- Generally accepted
- Not permanent

### Bleaching

- Removes unwanted colour
- Common for jadeite (with polymer impregnation)
- Pearls (not covered in detail)

### Polymer Impregnation

**Jadeite Grades**:
| Grade | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| A-Jade | Untreated (wax only) |
| B-Jade | Bleached + polymer filled |
| C-Jade | Dyed |
| B+C Jade | Bleached, filled, and dyed |

**Detection**:
- FTIR: Polymer absorption peaks
- UV: May fluoresce
- SG: May be lower

### Opal Treatments

**Smoke treatment (Matrix opal)**:
- Darkens background to enhance play-of-colour
- Common for Ethiopian and Mexican opal
- Carbon deposited in pores
- Permanent but artificial enhancement

**Sugar/acid treatment**:
- Traditional method for boulder/matrix opal
- Impregnate with sugar, carbonise with acid
- Darkens background
- Still used commercially

**Polymer/resin impregnation**:
- Stabilises porous opals
- Common for Ethiopian hydrophane opal
- Prevents water absorption and crazing
- May darken appearance
- FTIR detects resin

**Thin-film coating**:
- Enhances play-of-colour visibility
- Applied to back surface
- Creates "black opal" appearance from lighter material
- Detection: examine with magnification, immersion

**Detection methods**:
| Treatment | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Smoke | Even dark colour, may show in fractures |
| Sugar/acid | Dark colour, may be patchy |
| Polymer | FTIR, lower SG, fluorescence |
| Coating | Visible layer at back, scratches |

**Disclosure**:
- All treatments should be disclosed
- "Treated", "stabilised", "enhanced" terminology
- Natural black opal commands significant premium over treated

## Disclosure Requirements

### Industry Standards

**CIBJO (World Jewellery Confederation)**:
- All treatments must be disclosed
- Treatment must be described
- Durability information required

**FTC (US)**:
- Disclosure required for all treatments
- Affects value significantly

### What Must Be Disclosed

| Lead glass filling | Mandatory (significant value impact) |
| Oiling (emerald) | Required (degree of treatment) |
| Surface diffusion | Mandatory |
| Irradiation | Required |
| Coating | Mandatory |
