# Colour Grading Guide

Systematic colour assessment for coloured gemstones.

## Colour Components

### The Three Dimensions of Colour

| Component | Definition | Scale |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Hue** | The basic colour (red, blue, green, etc.) | Colour wheel position |
| **Saturation** | Colour purity/intensity | Grey to vivid |
| **Tone** | Lightness or darkness | Light to dark |

### Hue Classification

**Primary hues**: Red, Blue, Yellow, Green
**Secondary hues**: Orange, Purple (violet)
**Modifier hues**: Describe shifts (e.g., "slightly purplish red")

**Hue notation examples**:
| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| R | Pure red |
| slpR | Slightly purplish red |
| pR | Purplish red |
| rP | Reddish purple |
| P | Pure purple |

### Saturation Scale

| Level | Description | Value Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Greyish | Lowest |
| 2 | Slightly greyish | Low |
| 3 | Moderately strong | Moderate |
| 4 | Strong | Good |
| 5 | Vivid | Highest |
| 6 | Intense | Very high (some stones) |

**Note**: Saturation 6 may cause darkness; 5 often optimal

### Tone Scale

| Level | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Very light | May lack colour |
| 2 | Light | Pastel range |
| 3 | Medium-light | Good for many gems |
| 4 | Medium | Often optimal |
| 5 | Medium-dark | Still good |
| 6 | Dark | May lose colour |
| 7 | Very dark | Usually too dark |

**Optimal tone**: Varies by species; generally 4-6 for most gems

## Grading by Species

### Ruby

**Ideal colour**: "Pigeon blood" red

| Quality | Hue | Saturation | Tone |
|---------|-----|------------|------|
| Exceptional | Pure R to slpR | 5-6 (vivid) | 4-5 (medium) |
| Fine | R to pR | 4-5 | 4-6 |
| Good | Variable R | 3-4 | 3-6 |
| Commercial | Any red | 2-4 | Variable |

**Colour considerations**:
- Too much purple: Detracts
- Too much orange: "Pigeon blood" may accept slight
- Too dark: Loses red, appears maroon
- Too light: Appears pink (sapphire?)

### Blue Sapphire

**Ideal colour**: Medium vivid blue ("Royal blue" or "Cornflower")

| Quality | Hue | Saturation | Tone |
|---------|-----|------------|------|
| Exceptional | Pure B to vslgB | 5 (vivid) | 4-5 |
| Fine | B to vslgB | 4-5 | 4-6 |
| Good | Variable B | 3-4 | 3-6 |
| Commercial | Any blue | 2-4 | Variable |

**Colour considerations**:
- Grey modifier: Reduces value significantly
- Too dark (inky): Common problem in Australian/Thai
- Too light: "Pastel" — lower value
- Green modifier: Generally detracts

### Emerald

**Ideal colour**: Medium-toned vivid green

| Quality | Hue | Saturation | Tone |
|---------|-----|------------|------|
| Exceptional | slblG to G | 5-6 (vivid) | 4-5 |
| Fine | G to slyG | 4-5 | 4-6 |
| Good | Variable G | 3-4 | 3-6 |
| Commercial | Any green | 2-4 | Variable |

**Colour considerations**:
- Yellow modifier: Colombian characteristic; slight acceptable
- Blue modifier: Zambian characteristic; some prefer
- Too light: Less valuable
- Too dark: Loses vibrancy

### Padparadscha Sapphire

**Ideal colour**: Pink-orange (lotus flower)

| Quality | Hue | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Exceptional | Equal pink-orange | Delicate balance |
| Fine | Slight lean either way | Still balanced |
| Acceptable | Noticeable lean | Still both colours |
| Not padparadscha | Dominant single colour | Just pink or orange |

**Critical notes**:
- No strict definition agreed upon
- Laboratory opinions vary
- Certificate essential for premium

### Alexandrite

**Quality factors**: Colour change strength

| Quality | Day Colour | Night Colour | Change % |
|---------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Exceptional | Strong green | Strong red | 90-100% |
| Fine | Good green | Good red/purple | 70-90% |
| Good | Moderate | Moderate | 50-70% |
| Commercial | Weak | Weak | <50% |

**Both colours matter**:
- Attractive daylight colour important
- Strong change to red most valued
- Purple in incandescent acceptable

### Tanzanite

**Ideal colour**: Strong violet-blue

| Quality | Hue | Saturation | Tone |
|---------|-----|------------|------|
| Exceptional | vB to bV | 5-6 | 5-6 |
| Fine | Violet-blue | 4-5 | 4-6 |
| Good | Blue-violet | 3-4 | 3-6 |
| Commercial | Light violet | 2-3 | Variable |

**Colour notes**:
- Pleochroism affects face-up colour
- Cutting orientation matters
- Deeper colours command premium

### Spinel

**Red spinel grading** (similar to ruby):

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Pure vivid red, no modifiers |
| Fine | Strong red, slight modifiers |
| Good | Good saturation, acceptable hue |
| Commercial | Lighter or modified |

**Pink spinel**:
- Hot/vivid pink most valued
- "Mahenge pink" = premium descriptor

### Tourmaline

**Varies by variety**:

| Variety | Ideal Colour |
|---------|--------------|
| Rubellite | Saturated red (accepts purple) |
| Chrome | Rich green (chromium) |
| Indicolite | Saturated blue |
| Paraíba | Neon blue-green (copper) |

**Paraíba special notes**:
- Neon quality essential
- Saturation without darkness
- Electric/glowing appearance

## Colour Grading Systems

### GIA System

Uses combination of:
- Hue position (31 positions)
- Saturation (6 levels)
- Tone (7 levels)

**Notation**: "Medium vivid slightly purplish Red" = specific position

### GRS System

**Colour descriptors** (examples):
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Pigeon Blood | Top ruby colour |
| Royal Blue | Top sapphire colour |
| Vivid | Highest saturation |
| Intense | Very high saturation |

### AGL System

Uses specific terminology for top colours with detailed descriptions

## Viewing Conditions

### Standard Conditions

| Factor | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| Light source | D65 (daylight equivalent) |
| Background | Neutral grey or white |
| Viewing angle | Face-up primarily |
| Distance | Arm's length |
| Time of day | Consistent |

### Light Source Effects

| Light | Effect on Colour |
|-------|------------------|
| Daylight (north window) | Neutral reference |
| Incandescent | Enhances red, yellow |
| Fluorescent (cool) | Enhances blue, green |
| LED (variable) | Depends on spectrum |

### Important Practices

1. **Compare to master stones** when possible
2. **View in multiple lights** for complete assessment
3. **Document lighting** used for grading
4. **Rest eyes** between stones
5. **Consistent environment** for accuracy

## Colour Distribution

### Zoning Assessment

| Distribution | Description | Value Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Even | Uniform colour | Premium |
| Slight zoning | Minor visible | Minimal impact |
| Obvious zoning | Clearly visible | Moderate reduction |
| Strong zoning | Dominant feature | Significant reduction |

### Extinction

| Level | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| None | Colour throughout | Best |
| Minor | Some dark areas when tilted | Minimal |
| Moderate | Noticeable dark patches | Reduces value |
| Severe | Large dead areas | Significant reduction |

### Window

| Level | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| None | Colour throughout | Best |
| Small | Minor see-through | Minimal |
| Moderate | Clear window visible | Reduces value |
| Large | Major transparency loss | Significant reduction |
