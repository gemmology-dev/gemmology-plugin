# Clarity Types and Grading

Clarity assessment standards for coloured gemstones.

## GIA Clarity Type System

### Type I (Usually Eye-Clean)

Gems that typically form with very few inclusions:

| Gemstone | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Aquamarine | Very clean typical |
| Blue topaz | Usually very clean |
| Citrine | Normally clean |
| Green tourmaline | Cleaner than rubellite |
| Kunzite | Usually clean |
| Morganite | Typically clean |
| Smoky quartz | Usually clean |
| Tanzanite | Often eye-clean |
| Yellow chrysoberyl | Typically clean |
| Zircon | Usually clean |

**Grading expectations**: Eye-clean standard; visible inclusions significantly reduce value

### Type II (Usually Included)

Gems that typically form with some inclusions:

| Gemstone | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Alexandrite | Often included |
| Amethyst | Usually has some inclusions |
| Andalusite | Typically included |
| Iolite | Usually has inclusions |
| Peridot | Typically has visible inclusions |
| Ruby | Almost always included |
| Sapphire (all colours) | Usually has some inclusions |
| Spinel | Variable |
| Tourmaline (most) | Often included |

**Grading expectations**: Minor visible inclusions acceptable; eye-clean commands premium

### Type III (Almost Always Included)

Gems that almost always contain visible inclusions:

| Gemstone | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Emerald | "Jardin" characteristic |
| Red beryl | Almost always included |
| Rubellite tourmaline | Typically heavily included |
| Watermelon tourmaline | Usually included |
| Sphene | Often included |

**Grading expectations**: Inclusions expected; grading considers visibility and impact

## Grading Criteria

### What to Assess

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Size | Larger inclusions more impactful |
| Number | Multiple inclusions compound effect |
| Location | Centre vs edge matters |
| Relief | Contrast with host |
| Nature | Type affects perception |

### Viewing Standards

| Parameter | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Distance | Arm's length (~30-35cm) |
| Lighting | Diffused overhead |
| Background | Neutral |
| Position | Face-up primarily |
| Eye | Normal or corrected vision |

### Location Weighting

| Location | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Under table facet | Maximum impact |
| Near centre | High impact |
| At girdle | Moderate impact |
| Under crown facets | Lower impact |
| In pavilion | Lower if not visible face-up |

## Species-Specific Standards

### Ruby

**Expectations**: Type II - usually included

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Eye-clean or nearly so (rare) |
| Fine | Minor visible inclusions |
| Good | Noticeable but not distracting |
| Commercial | Obvious inclusions |

**Important notes**:
- Silk inclusions can be positive (asterism)
- Eye-clean rubies are very rare
- "Jardin" not expected like emerald

### Sapphire

**Expectations**: Type II - usually included

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Eye-clean |
| Fine | Minor visible inclusions |
| Good | Some visible inclusions |
| Commercial | Obviously included |

**Colour-specific notes**:
- Kashmir: Microscopic inclusions create "velvet"
- Star sapphires: Silk required for star
- Padparadscha: Clean stones rare

### Emerald

**Expectations**: Type III - almost always included

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Eye-clean (extremely rare) |
| Fine | Minor visible, not distracting |
| Good | Moderate "jardin" |
| Commercial | Heavy inclusions |

**Industry tolerance**:
- "Jardin" (garden) expected and named
- Totally clean emeralds nearly non-existent
- Clarity less penalised than other gems
- Colour prioritised over clarity

### Alexandrite

**Expectations**: Type II - usually included

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Eye-clean (rare) |
| Fine | Minor visible |
| Good | Moderate inclusions |
| Commercial | Obviously included |

**Notes**:
- Clean alexandrite very rare
- Colour change quality often prioritises

### Spinel

**Expectations**: Type II but often cleaner

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Loupe clean to eye-clean |
| Fine | Minor inclusions |
| Good | Some visible |
| Commercial | Obviously included |

**Notes**:
- Fine spinels often very clean
- Cleaner than ruby/sapphire generally

### Paraíba Tourmaline

**Expectations**: Type III - typically included

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceptional | Eye-clean (extremely rare) |
| Fine | Minor visible inclusions |
| Good | Moderate inclusions |
| Commercial | Obviously included |

**Notes**:
- Eye-clean Paraíba extremely rare
- Colour intensity often prioritised
- Inclusions tolerated for exceptional colour

## Inclusion Types and Impact

### Negative Impact

| Inclusion Type | Impact Level |
|----------------|--------------|
| Large feathers/fractures | High (durability concern) |
| Dark crystals under table | High (visibility) |
| Dense clouds | Moderate-High (affects brilliance) |
| Obvious colour zoning | Moderate (appearance) |
| Surface-reaching fractures | High (durability) |

### Neutral to Positive Impact

| Inclusion Type | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| Fine silk (sapphire) | Positive for star |
| Silk (alexandrite) | Positive for cat's eye |
| Three-phase (emerald) | Neutral (origin indicator) |
| Horsetail (demantoid) | Positive (increases value) |
| Characteristic fingerprints | Neutral (natural) |

## Practical Grading Tips

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Clean the stone** thoroughly
2. **View face-up** at arm's length
3. **Note immediately visible** inclusions
4. **Scan systematically** across surface
5. **View from sides** for additional inclusions
6. **Use 10x loupe** for confirmation
7. **Assess overall impact**
8. **Assign grade** based on species type

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Applying diamond standards | Use coloured stone grades |
| Ignoring type classification | Adjust expectations |
| Over-grading based on price | Grade objectively |
| Missing pavilion inclusions | Check all angles |
| Ignoring durability impact | Note surface-reaching features |

### Recording Clarity

```
Type classification: II
Visibility: Minor inclusions visible at arm's length
Location: Small feather near girdle
Impact: Minimal - not visible face-up
Grade: SI (Slightly Included)
Durability concerns: None
```

## Value Impact

### General Guidelines

| Grade Movement | Approximate Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|
| EC to SI | -10-20% |
| SI to MI | -20-40% |
| MI to HI | -40-60%+ |

**Species-specific adjustments**:
- Emerald: Less penalty for inclusions
- Ruby: Clean stones command major premium
- Spinel: Expected to be cleaner

### Market Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Type I gem with inclusions | Significant penalty |
| Type III gem eye-clean | Significant premium |
| Durability-affecting | Always penalised |
| Character inclusions | May add value (horsetail) |
