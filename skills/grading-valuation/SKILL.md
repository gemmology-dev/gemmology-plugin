# Grading and Valuation

Guidance on evaluating coloured gemstone quality using professional grading systems. Unlike diamonds, coloured stone grading is less standardised—multiple systems exist.

## The Value Factors

### Overview

Coloured gemstone value depends on:

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Colour** | 50-70% | Most important factor |
| **Clarity** | 10-30% | Depends on gem type |
| **Cut** | 10-20% | Often undervalued |
| **Carat weight** | Variable | Price per carat increases with size |
| **Origin** | Variable | Significant for ruby, sapphire, emerald |
| **Treatment** | Variable | Untreated commands premium |

## Colour Grading

### The Three Components

**1. Hue**: The basic colour (e.g., red, blue, green)
- Primary hue
- Secondary/modifier hue
- Position on colour wheel

**2. Tone**: Lightness or darkness (0-10 scale)
| Tone | Description | Desirability |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 0-1 | Very light | Too pale |
| 2-3 | Light | Acceptable |
| 4-6 | Medium | Ideal for most gems |
| 7-8 | Dark | Risk of over-dark |
| 9-10 | Very dark | Generally too dark |

**3. Saturation**: Colour intensity/purity
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Strong/Vivid | Most valuable |
| Moderate | Good quality |
| Weak/Greyish | Lower value |
| Brownish | Generally undesirable (exceptions exist) |

### GIA Colour Grading System

**Hue notation**: Uses colour wheel positions
- R = Red
- oR = Orangey-red
- rO = Reddish-orange
- O = Orange
- etc.

**Full description**: hue + tone + saturation
- Example: "Medium-dark, moderately strong, slightly purplish red"

### Ideal Colours by Gemstone

| Gemstone | Ideal Colour Description |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Ruby** | "Pigeon blood" - medium-dark, vivid, slightly purplish red |
| **Blue Sapphire** | Medium-dark, vivid, violetish-blue (Kashmir-type) |
| **Emerald** | Medium, vivid, slightly bluish green |
| **Padparadscha** | Pinkish-orange to orangey-pink, medium saturation |
| **Tanzanite** | Medium-dark, vivid, violetish-blue |
| **Paraiba Tourmaline** | "Neon" blue-green, high saturation |
| **Spinel (red)** | Vivid red, minimal pink modifier |
| **Tsavorite** | Vivid green, medium tone |

### Colour Modifiers and Value

| Modifier | Effect on Value |
|----------|-----------------|
| Grey mask | Decreases value |
| Brown mask | Usually decreases (except hessonite, some sapphires) |
| Pure hue | Increases value |
| Window (extinction) | Decreases value |

## Clarity Grading

### GIA Clarity Types

Gemstones are categorised by typical inclusion level:

| Type | Expected Clarity | Examples |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Type I** | Usually eye-clean | Aquamarine, Topaz, Tanzanite, Blue Zircon |
| **Type II** | Usually included | Ruby, Sapphire, Garnet, Spinel, Peridot, Tourmaline |
| **Type III** | Almost always included | Emerald, Red Tourmaline, Watermelon Tourmaline |

### Clarity Grades

| Grade | Type I | Type II | Type III |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| VVS | Eye-clean, minute under 10x | Minor under 10x | Obvious under 10x |
| VS | Minor under 10x | Noticeable under 10x | Eye-visible, not detracting |
| SI1 | Noticeable under 10x | Eye-visible | Eye-visible, somewhat detracting |
| SI2 | Eye-visible | Obvious to eye | Obvious, moderately detracting |
| I1 | Moderate effect | Prominent | Prominent, seriously affecting appearance |
| I2 | Serious effect | Severe effect | Severe effect |
| I3 | Severe effect | Renders unsuitable | Renders unsuitable |

### Clarity Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Size | Larger inclusions = more visible |
| Number | More inclusions = lower grade |
| Position | Under table = more visible |
| Contrast | High contrast = more noticeable |
| Type | Solid vs liquid; colour |

### Acceptable Inclusions

Some inclusions are acceptable or even desirable:
- Horsetail in demantoid (diagnostic)
- Silk in Kashmir sapphire (creates velvety look)
- Jardin in emerald (expected)

## Cut Grading

### Cut Factors

**1. Proportions**
- Table size
- Crown angle/height
- Pavilion depth
- Girdle thickness
- Culet size

**2. Finish**
- Polish quality
- Facet meet precision
- Symmetry

**3. Brilliance and Light Performance**
- Windowing (light leakage through pavilion)
- Extinction (dark areas)
- Brilliance (light return)
- Scintillation (sparkle)

### Windowing and Extinction

| Issue | Cause | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Window | Pavilion too shallow | See-through effect, flat appearance |
| Extinction | Various | Dead/dark areas in stone |
| Bow-tie | Oval/marquise/pear cuts | Dark area across centre |

### Cut Quality Grades

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Excellent | Ideal proportions, minimal window/extinction, excellent polish |
| Very Good | Minor deviations, slight window/extinction |
| Good | Noticeable window/extinction, acceptable |
| Fair | Significant light loss |
| Poor | Severe issues, requires recut |

### Cutting Styles

| Style | Characteristics | Best For |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Brilliant | Maximum sparkle | Most transparent gems |
| Step (emerald) | Elegant, shows colour | Large, clean stones |
| Mixed | Combines brilliant/step | Compromise approach |
| Cabochon | Domed, no facets | Phenomenal gems, opaque |

## Carat Weight

### Price Per Carat Progression

Price per carat typically increases at certain thresholds:

| Weight | Premium | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| <1ct | Base | Common sizes |
| 1ct | 20-50%+ | Psychological threshold |
| 2ct | Higher | Less common |
| 3ct | Higher still | Rare in fine quality |
| 5ct+ | Significant | Very rare |
| 10ct+ | Collector | Museum-quality rarity |

### Size vs Weight

Same carat weight, different dimensions:
- SG affects apparent size
- High SG stones (corundum) appear smaller per carat
- Low SG stones (beryl) appear larger per carat

## Origin and Treatment Impact

### Origin Premiums

| Stone | Origin | Premium |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Ruby | Burma (Mogok) | 50-300%+ |
| Sapphire | Kashmir | 100-500%+ |
| Sapphire | Burma | 30-100% |
| Sapphire | Sri Lanka | 10-50% |
| Emerald | Colombian | 30-100% |

### Treatment Impact

| Treatment | Value Impact |
|-----------|--------------|
| No treatment | Highest premium |
| Heat only (corundum) | Moderate premium |
| Heat + minor flux | Some premium |
| Minor oil (emerald) | Accepted, minor impact |
| Moderate oil | Some reduction |
| Significant filling | Major reduction |
| Lead glass filling | Significant reduction |
| Diffusion | Major reduction |
