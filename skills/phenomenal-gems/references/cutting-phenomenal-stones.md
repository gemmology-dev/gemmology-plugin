# Cutting Phenomenal Stones

Guidelines for orienting and cutting gemstones to display optical phenomena.

## General Principles

### Orientation is Critical
The entire value of a phenomenal stone depends on proper orientation during cutting:
- Phenomenon must be centred
- Effect must be strong and well-defined
- Stone must be oriented BEFORE shape is determined

### Cabochon Dome Height

| Dome Height | Effect on Phenomenon | Best For |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **High dome** | Star/eye appears smaller, sharper | Dense silk, weak effects |
| **Medium dome** | Balanced appearance | Most phenomenal gems |
| **Low dome** | Star/eye appears larger, may diffuse | Very strong effects |
| **Too flat** | Phenomenon may not appear | Avoid |

## Star Stones (Asterism)

### Orientation Requirements

**Six-rayed stars** (corundum, garnet):
- C-axis must be perpendicular to base
- All three silk directions at 60° must be equally represented
- Base must be parallel to basal pinacoid

**Four-rayed stars** (diopside):
- Oriented to intersecting needle sets
- Both directions must be represented

### Cutting Guidelines

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Identify silk direction | Use fibre-optic light |
| 2 | Mark c-axis orientation | Perpendicular to base |
| 3 | Rough to cabochon shape | Keep extra material |
| 4 | Check star under point light | Adjust if off-centre |
| 5 | Final polish | Maintain dome symmetry |

### Common Problems

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Off-centre star | Misoriented rough | Cannot fix after cutting |
| Weak rays | Insufficient silk density | Cannot improve |
| Uneven rays | Uneven silk distribution | Re-orient if possible |
| Leggy star | Asymmetric silk | Accept or re-cut |
| No star | Wrong orientation | Re-orient completely |

### Star Quality Optimization

**To sharpen star**:
- Higher dome
- Better polish
- Finer silk preferred

**To enlarge star coverage**:
- Lower dome (within limits)
- May sacrifice sharpness

## Cat's Eye Stones (Chatoyancy)

### Orientation Requirements

- Silk/tubes must be parallel to length of cabochon
- Eye will appear perpendicular to inclusion direction
- C-axis usually parallel to eye direction

### Cutting Guidelines

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Identify needle/tube direction | Transmitted light |
| 2 | Orient for eye perpendicular to length | Mark on rough |
| 3 | Shape elongated cabochon | 2:1 or 3:1 ratio ideal |
| 4 | Cut perpendicular dome | Eye follows length |
| 5 | Check "milk and honey" | Under single point light |
| 6 | Polish to high lustre | Essential for sharp eye |

### Ideal Proportions

| Ratio (L:W) | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| 3:1 | Traditional, elongated appearance |
| 2:1 | Balanced, good for rings |
| 1.5:1 | Oval, softer look |
| 1:1 | Round, less traditional |

### Common Problems

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Double eye | Two needle directions | Re-orient or accept |
| Diffuse eye | Sparse inclusions | Cannot improve |
| Off-centre eye | Misorientation | Re-cut if material allows |
| No milk-and-honey | Wrong material or weak effect | Inherent to stone |

## Moonstone (Adularescence)

### Orientation Requirements

- Sheen appears perpendicular to exsolution lamellae
- Cut to maximize blue sheen visibility from face-up
- Orientation determined by internal structure

### Cutting Guidelines

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Locate adularescence direction | Tilt under light |
| 2 | Orient for face-up sheen | Mark orientation |
| 3 | Cut cabochon or faceted | Both work |
| 4 | Polish carefully | Avoid scratches |

### Cut Styles

| Style | Effect | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Cabochon** | Traditional, soft sheen | Most common |
| **Faceted** | Sharper, may lose sheen | Requires good material |
| **Carved** | Artistic | Common for moonstone |

## Labradorite (Labradorescence)

### Orientation Requirements

- Flash appears from specific direction
- Must orient for best colour when face-up
- Each rough piece unique

### Cutting Guidelines

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Find best flash direction | View from all angles |
| 2 | Mark orientation for face-up view | Critical step |
| 3 | Cut flat or low cabochon | High dome unnecessary |
| 4 | May leave irregular shape | To preserve colour area |
| 5 | Polish to high lustre | Enhances effect |

### Special Considerations

- Freeform shapes acceptable to maximize colour
- Spectrolite (full spectrum) most valuable orientation
- May sacrifice size to capture best colour area
- Cleavage planes can affect durability

## Opal (Play of Colour)

### Orientation Requirements

- Play of colour comes from specific layers/areas
- Orient to show best colours face-up
- Consider pattern distribution

### Cutting Guidelines

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Identify colour-bearing layer | In wet rough |
| 2 | Orient for face-up colour | May require sacrifice |
| 3 | Determine optimal depth | Balance colour vs. size |
| 4 | Shape to preserve pattern | Freeform acceptable |
| 5 | Polish carefully | Opal is soft |

### Special Considerations

**Black opal**:
- Preserve dark potch backing if possible
- Enhances play of colour contrast

**Boulder opal**:
- Leave ironstone matrix attached
- Natural backing supports thin colour layer

**Crystal opal**:
- Transparency adds depth
- May double or triplet if thin

**Fire opal**:
- Body colour primary, play secondary
- May facet if no play

### Doublets and Triplets

| Type | Structure | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Doublet** | Opal + backing | Support thin colour layer |
| **Triplet** | Cap + opal + backing | Protect and magnify |

## Colour-Change Gems

### Cutting Considerations

- Must show good colour in BOTH light types
- Orientation may affect which colours dominate
- Test under daylight AND incandescent during cutting

### Guidelines

| Consideration | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Test orientation | View under both light types |
| Maximize saturation | Both colours should be strong |
| Avoid grey zones | Can diminish change |
| Standard faceting | Usually appropriate |

## General Quality Factors for Phenomenal Cuts

### Cabochon Checklist

| Factor | Ideal | Issue if Wrong |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Symmetry | Perfect dome | Off-centre phenomenon |
| Base | Flat or slight curve | Instability in setting |
| Girdle | Consistent thickness | Weakness |
| Polish | Mirror finish | Dull phenomenon |
| Proportions | Appropriate for species | Weak or distorted effect |

### Phenomenon Checklist

| Factor | Ideal | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Centration | Dead centre | Cannot fix after cutting |
| Sharpness | As sharp as possible | Determined by inclusions |
| Brightness | Strong contrast | Inherent to material |
| Movement | Smooth tracking | Test with light movement |
| Coverage | Full dome | Better than partial |

## Equipment for Cutting Phenomenal Stones

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Fibre-optic light | Find silk direction |
| Penlight | Check phenomenon |
| Dark background | Evaluate effect |
| Goniometer | Measure dome angle |
| Polariscope | Identify crystal axes |

## Recovery Tips

| Issue | Possible Fix |
|-------|--------------|
| Off-centre star | Re-cut smaller if material allows |
| Weak phenomenon | Higher dome may help slightly |
| Scratched dome | Re-polish carefully |
| Asymmetric dome | Re-shape maintaining orientation |
| Flat spot | Re-dome if enough material |
