# Phenomenal Gemstones

Guidance on understanding, identifying, and evaluating gemstones that display special optical phenomena beyond ordinary colour and brilliance.

## Categories of Phenomena

Nine recognised optical phenomena in gemmology:

| Phenomenon | Cause | Key Examples |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| Asterism | Oriented needle inclusions | Star sapphire, Star ruby |
| Chatoyancy | Parallel fibres/needles | Cat's eye chrysoberyl |
| Adularescence | Light scattering in layers | Moonstone |
| Labradorescence | Interference in lamellae | Labradorite, Spectrolite |
| Play-of-colour | Diffraction from silica spheres | Opal |
| Colour change | Different absorption in light sources | Alexandrite |
| Aventurescence | Reflections from inclusions | Sunstone, Aventurine |
| Iridescence | Thin-film interference | Fire agate |
| Orient | Surface iridescence | Pearl |

## Asterism (Star Effect)

### Mechanism

Caused by light reflecting from multiple sets of oriented needle-like inclusions (usually rutile silk) intersecting at specific angles.

### Types of Stars

| Rays | Cause | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| 4-ray | Two sets of needles at 90° | Some diopside, some garnets |
| 6-ray | Three sets at 60° | Corundum (ruby, sapphire) |
| 12-ray | Six sets or twinning | Rare corundum, some quartz |

### Star Corundum

**Star Ruby**:
- Caused by rutile (TiO₂) silk oriented along crystal axes
- Best from Burma (Myanmar) - sharp, centred stars
- Sri Lanka - often with translucent body
- Thai/African - typically opaque

**Star Sapphire**:
- Same mechanism as star ruby
- Famous "Star of India" (563 ct)
- Black star sapphires: often treated or synthetic

### Quality Factors

| Factor | Ideal | Poor |
|--------|-------|------|
| Star sharpness | Crisp, well-defined rays | Fuzzy, diffuse |
| Star completeness | All rays visible, even | Missing or uneven rays |
| Star centring | Centred on dome | Off-centre |
| Star movement | Moves smoothly across dome | Static or jumpy |
| Body colour | Attractive, saturated | Dull, too dark/light |
| Transparency | Translucent preferred | Opaque acceptable |

### Cutting Requirements

- High-domed cabochon essential
- Base must be parallel to silk orientation
- Proper orientation critical for centred star

## Chatoyancy (Cat's Eye Effect)

### Mechanism

Single band of light caused by parallel fibrous inclusions or tube-like cavities reflecting light perpendicular to their length.

### Cat's Eye Chrysoberyl (Cymophane)

The most valuable chatoyant gem. When unqualified, "cat's eye" refers only to chrysoberyl.

**Quality factors**:
- Sharp, well-defined eye
- Eye opens and closes with light movement
- "Milk and honey" effect: one side lighter than other
- Honey-yellow to greenish-yellow body colour
- High translucency

**Grading the eye**:
| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Excellent | Sharp, silvery-white eye, strong milk-and-honey |
| Good | Clear eye, some milk-and-honey |
| Fair | Slightly fuzzy eye |
| Poor | Diffuse or multiple eyes |

### Other Chatoyant Gems

| Gemstone | Cause | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Cat's eye tourmaline | Tube inclusions | Various colours |
| Cat's eye quartz | Fibre inclusions | Grey, yellow, green |
| Tiger's eye | Fibrous structure | Gold-brown, blue (hawk's eye) |
| Cat's eye apatite | Needle inclusions | Green, yellow |
| Cat's eye sillimanite | Fibrous habit | Greyish |
| Cat's eye scapolite | Needle inclusions | Pink, yellow |
| Cat's eye opal | Play-of-colour in band | Very rare |

### Nomenclature

**Correct**: "Cat's eye tourmaline", "Cat's eye quartz"
**Incorrect**: "Cat's eye" alone (unless chrysoberyl)

## Adularescence

### Mechanism

Billowy, floating light effect caused by light scattering between alternating layers of orthoclase and albite feldspar with slightly different refractive indices.

### Moonstone

**Rainbow Moonstone** (actually labradorite):
- Multicoloured sheen
- Different mineral species
- Trade name only

**True Moonstone** (orthoclase/adularia):
- Blue to white adularescence
- Best from Sri Lanka, India
- Body colour: colourless, peach, grey

**Quality factors**:
| Factor | Premium | Lower |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Adularescence colour | Blue | White |
| Adularescence intensity | Strong, floating | Weak, patchy |
| Body colour | Colourless, transparent | Milky, opaque |
| Centring | Centred on dome | Off-centre |

### Cutting

- Cabochon cut required
- Orientation crucial for best effect
- High dome enhances adularescence

## Labradorescence

### Mechanism

Iridescent colour flashes caused by light interference from repeated twinning lamellae (thin parallel layers) in labradorite feldspar.

### Labradorite

**Colours**: Blue, green, gold, orange, purple (full spectrum possible)
**Origin**: Madagascar, Finland (Spectrolite), Canada

**Spectrolite**: Trade name for high-quality Finnish labradorite showing full spectral colours.

### Quality Factors

| Factor | Premium | Lower |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Colour range | Full spectrum | Single colour |
| Intensity | Bright, vivid flashes | Dull, weak |
| Coverage | Entire surface | Partial |
| Body colour | Dark enhances contrast | Light, washed out |

## Play-of-Colour (Opal)

### Mechanism

Diffraction of light by orderly stacked silica spheres (150-400nm diameter). Sphere size determines colours:
- Smaller spheres → blue/violet
- Larger spheres → red/orange

### Opal Types

**Precious Opal** (play-of-colour):
| Type | Body Colour | Origin |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Black opal | Dark grey to black | Lightning Ridge, Australia |
| White opal | Light body | Coober Pedy, Australia |
| Crystal opal | Transparent | Various |
| Boulder opal | Ironstone matrix | Queensland, Australia |
| Fire opal | Orange body | Mexico (may lack play) |
| Ethiopian opal | Hydrophane type | Wollo, Ethiopia |

**Pattern Types**:
- Harlequin: Angular patches (most valuable)
- Pinfire: Small pinpoints
- Flash: Large flashes
- Broadflash: Rolling colour
- Flagstone: Irregular patches
- Palette: Sweeping colours

### Quality Factors

| Factor | Premium | Lower |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Body tone | Dark (black opal) | Milky white |
| Play colours | Red/orange present | Blue only |
| Pattern | Harlequin, broadflash | Weak pinfire |
| Brightness | Brilliant, vivid | Dull, hazy |
| Coverage | Full face | Patchy |

### Stability Concerns

- Some opals crack ("crazing") due to water loss
- Ethiopian hydrophane absorbs/releases water
- Avoid heat, chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners

## Colour Change

### Mechanism

Different light sources (daylight vs incandescent) have different spectral compositions. Colour-change gems have transmission windows that favour different colours depending on the illuminating light source.

### Alexandrite (Chrysoberyl)

The most famous colour-change gem: "Emerald by day, ruby by night"

**Colour change**:
- Daylight: Green to bluish-green
- Incandescent: Red to purplish-red

**Origin quality**:
| Origin | Typical Change | Value |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Russia (Urals) | Strong green ↔ red | Highest |
| Brazil | Moderate | High |
| Sri Lanka | Khaki ↔ brownish | Medium |
| Tanzania | Variable | Medium |
| India | Variable | Medium |

### Other Colour-Change Gems

| Gemstone | Daylight | Incandescent |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Colour-change sapphire | Blue/violet | Purple/red |
| Colour-change garnet | Blue-green | Red-purple |
| Colour-change spinel | Blue | Purple |
| Colour-change fluorite | Blue | Purple |
| Colour-change diaspore | Kiwi green | Pink-champagne |

### Evaluating Colour Change

- Percentage of hue shift (100% = complete)
- Strength of each colour
- Attractiveness of both colours
- Distinctness of change

## Aventurescence

### Mechanism

Glittery, spangled effect from light reflecting off flat, plate-like inclusions within the gem.

### Sunstone (Feldspar)

**Oregon Sunstone**: Copper platelets
- Schiller effect
- Can show colour (copper content)
- Transparent varieties valuable

**Indian Sunstone**: Hematite/goethite inclusions
- Typically orange body
- Metallic spangling

### Aventurine Quartz

- Green: Fuchsite (chrome mica) inclusions
- Orange/brown: Hematite/goethite inclusions
- Blue: Dumortierite inclusions (rare)
