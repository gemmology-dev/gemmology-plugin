# Inclusions and Internal Features

Guidance on identifying and interpreting inclusions in coloured gemstones—"nature's fingerprints" that reveal identity, origin, and natural vs synthetic status.

## Inclusion Categories

### By Origin

| Category | Formation | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Protogenetic** | Before host crystal | Pre-existing crystals trapped during growth |
| **Syngenetic** | During host growth | Crystals growing simultaneously |
| **Epigenetic** | After host formation | Fracture healing, exsolution |

### By Type

| Type | Description | Diagnostic Value |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Solid (mineral) | Crystals within host | Species identification, origin |
| Liquid | Fluid-filled cavities | Origin, natural/synthetic |
| Gas | Gas bubbles | Synthetic indicator |
| Two-phase | Liquid + gas | Common in natural stones |
| Three-phase | Solid + liquid + gas | Origin diagnostic |
| Negative crystals | Crystal-shaped voids | Growth environment |

## Fingerprint Inclusions

Healed fractures that leave characteristic patterns.

### Formation

1. Fracture forms in crystal
2. Later fluids enter fracture
3. Crystal material partially heals
4. Leaves distinctive pattern of residual fluid

### Appearance

- Network of tiny fluid-filled cavities
- Often look like actual fingerprint patterns
- May be lacy, wispy, or geometric
- Sometimes called "feathers"

### Diagnostic Value

- Strong indicator of natural origin
- Synthetics rarely show true fingerprints
- Flux-grown synthetics may show similar patterns (careful examination needed)

## Three-Phase Inclusions

Most diagnostic of inclusion types.

### Components

1. **Solid**: Usually a crystal (halite cube in Colombian emerald)
2. **Liquid**: Surrounding fluid
3. **Gas bubble**: Trapped gas

### Diagnostic Use

- **Colombian emerald**: Jagged cavities with halite cube + liquid + gas
- Virtually proves natural origin
- Three-phase inclusions very rare in synthetics

## Silk Inclusions

Fine needle-like inclusions, often rutile in corundum.

### Characteristics

- Extremely fine, hair-like needles
- Often in intersecting sets (60° in corundum)
- Can create asterism if dense enough
- Intact silk = unheated corundum
- Dissolved/broken silk = heat-treated

### Heat Treatment Detection

| Feature | Unheated | Heated |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Silk appearance | Intact, sharp needles | Broken, dissolved, "dotted" |
| Silk density | Original distribution | Reduced or absent |
| Colour zoning | Sharp boundaries | Diffused boundaries |
| Surface features | None | Pitting, flow marks |

## Growth Features

### Colour Zoning

- Angular (straight-line) zoning = natural growth
- Curved zoning = flame-fusion synthetic
- Chevron patterns = hydrothermal synthetic

### Growth Lines/Striae

| Pattern | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Angular/straight | Natural crystal growth |
| Curved | Flame-fusion (Verneuil) synthetic |
| Chevron | Hydrothermal synthetic |
| Swirl pattern | Flame-fusion synthetic |

## Natural vs Synthetic Identification

### Key Indicators of Natural Origin

| Feature | Reliability |
|---------|-------------|
| Three-phase inclusions | Very high |
| Fingerprint inclusions | High |
| Mineral inclusions (identified) | High |
| Angular growth zoning | Moderate |
| Colour zoning (natural pattern) | Moderate |
| Silk (intact) | Moderate |

### Key Indicators of Synthetic Origin

| Feature | Synthetic Type |
|---------|----------------|
| Curved striae | Flame-fusion (Verneuil) |
| Gas bubbles (spherical) | Flame-fusion |
| Flux inclusions (wispy, feather-like) | Flux-grown |
| Chevron growth | Hydrothermal |
| Seed plate | Hydrothermal |
| Platinum platelets | Flame-fusion |
| Too clean | Suspect all types |

## Microscopy Techniques

### Lighting Methods

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Darkfield | Most inclusions, general observation |
| Brightfield | Colour zoning, growth features |
| Oblique/fibre optic | Surface features, silk |
| Polarised light | Strain, twinning |
| Immersion | Internal features, reducing surface reflections |

### Magnification

- 10x loupe: Initial inspection
- 20-40x microscope: Standard examination
- Higher: Fine detail, silk examination
