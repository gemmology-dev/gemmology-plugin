# Synthetic Indicators by Growth Method

Diagnostic inclusions and features that identify synthetic gemstones.

## Flame-Fusion (Verneuil) Synthetics

### Characteristic Features

| Feature | Description | Visibility |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Curved striae** | Curved growth lines | 10x-40x with diffused light |
| **Gas bubbles** | Spherical voids, may be elongated | 10x, often numerous |
| **Undissolved powder** | White particles | Rare, from feed powder |
| **Colour banding** | Following curved growth | May show in polariscope |

### Curved Striae Detection

**Best viewing conditions**:
- Diffused transmitted light
- Immersion microscopy helps
- Rotate stone to find orientation
- May be very subtle

**Appearance**:
- Concentric curved lines
- Follow the shape of boule
- May be faint or strong
- Different from natural angular zones

### Gas Bubbles

**Types**:
| Type | Shape | Arrangement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Spherical | Perfect spheres | Random or clouds |
| Elongated | Stretched | Parallel to growth |
| Chains | String of bubbles | Linear |
| Profiled | Tadpole-shaped | Along growth direction |

**Distinguishing from natural fluid inclusions**:
- Synthetic bubbles usually empty (gas only)
- Natural fluid inclusions contain liquid ± gas ± crystals
- Synthetic bubbles often more regular

### Affected Species

| Synthetic | Common Colours | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Ruby | Red | Very common production |
| Blue sapphire | Blue | May show titanium |
| Star ruby | Red | Silk added intentionally |
| Star sapphire | Blue/grey | Silk added for star |

## Flux-Grown Synthetics

### Characteristic Features

| Feature | Description | Visibility |
|---------|-------------|------------|

| **Flux fingerprints** | Partially healed patterns | Resembles natural |
| **Platinum platelets** | Metallic triangular inclusions | Diagnostic, from crucibles |
| **Flux drops** | Solidified flux globules | Variable |
| **Roiled effect** | Turbulent appearance | Internal areas |
| **Seed crystal remnants** | Original seed visible | Rare |

### Flux Patterns

**Appearance**:
- Wispy, smoke-like veils
- May resemble natural fingerprints
- Often associated with platinum
- Can have "rain" or "comet" patterns

**Distinguishing from natural**:
- Flux has characteristic texture
- Platinum crystals absent in natural
- Pattern geometry differs
- Often concentrated in zones

### Platinum Inclusions

**Characteristics**:
- Bright metallic lustre
- Triangular or hexagonal shapes
- May show twinning
- Dissolve partially in flux

**Sizes**: Range from tiny platelets to larger crystals visible at 10x

## Hydrothermal Synthetics

### Characteristic Features

| Feature | Description | Visibility |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Chevron/zigzag growth** | Zigzag pattern | With crossed polars |
| **Seed plate** | Flat boundary | May be visible |
| **Nail-head spicules** | Distinctive inclusions | Characteristic |
| **Colour zoning** | Sharp, angular | Different from natural |
| **Breadcrumb inclusions** | Small clustered particles | Some producers |
| **Two-phase inclusions** | Resemble natural | Require careful study |

### Growth Pattern Recognition

**Chevron growth**:
- Zigzag pattern following crystal growth
- Visible in polariscope
- Distinctive of hydrothermal process
- May be subtle or obvious

**Seed plate indicators**:
- Sharp planar boundary
- May show different refractive index
- Often parallel to table facet
- Colour difference at boundary

### Nail-Head Spicules

**Characteristics**:
- Nail or spike shaped inclusions
- Pointed at one end, flat at other
- Characteristic of some hydrothermal emeralds
- Diagnostic when present

### Species Affected

| Synthetic | Common Types | Key Features |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Emerald | Biron, Regency, Malossi | Chevron growth, clean |
| Beryl | Various | Angular zoning |
| Quartz | Amethyst, citrine | Too clean, chevron growth |

## Czochralski (Pulled) Synthetics

### Characteristic Features

| Feature | Description | Visibility |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Extreme cleanliness** | Very few inclusions | Immediate impression |
| **Swirl marks** | Spiral growth lines | Subtle, immersion |
| **Gas bubbles** | Rarely present | If poor process control |
| **Perfect colour** | No zoning | Unnaturally uniform |

### Species Affected

### Main Product

- **Cubic zirconia (CZ)**: Primary gemstone produced
- Not used for corundum or emerald

## Important Notes

1. **Some synthetics closely mimic natural** - require careful study
2. **Absence of typical synthetic features** doesn't confirm natural
3. **Combined testing essential** - use multiple methods
4. **New growth methods emerge** - stay updated
5. **When in doubt, consult laboratory** - get professional opinion
