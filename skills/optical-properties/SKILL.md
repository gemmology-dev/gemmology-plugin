# Optical Properties of Gemstones

Guidance on understanding and measuring the optical properties of coloured gemstones, essential for identification using standard gemmological instruments.

## Refractive Index (RI)

The refractive index measures how much light slows and bends when entering a gemstone.

### Measurement

Use a **refractometer** with contact liquid (RI 1.81) and monochromatic light (sodium lamp preferred).

**Reading types**:
- **Singly refractive (SR)**: One shadow edge, constant in all directions
- **Doubly refractive (DR)**: Two shadow edges, vary with rotation

### RI Ranges by Gemstone

Reference: `references/refractive-index-table.md`

**Key diagnostic values**:

| Gemstone | RI Range | Optical Character |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Corundum | 1.762-1.770 | Uniaxial negative |
| Spinel | 1.712-1.736 | Isotropic (SR) |
| Chrysoberyl | 1.744-1.755 | Biaxial positive |
| Topaz | 1.609-1.643 | Biaxial positive |
| Beryl | 1.565-1.602 | Uniaxial negative |
| Tourmaline | 1.616-1.650 | Uniaxial negative |
| Quartz | 1.544-1.553 | Uniaxial positive |
| Peridot | 1.650-1.703 | Biaxial positive |
| Zircon (high) | 1.925-1.984 | Uniaxial positive |
| Garnet (varies) | 1.730-1.890 | Isotropic (SR) |

### Over-the-Limit Stones

Stones with RI above 1.81 (refractometer limit):
- Zircon (1.92-1.98): Use distant vision method
- Demantoid (1.88-1.89): Appears as vague shadow
- Sphalerite (2.37): Far over limit
- Diamond (2.42): Not applicable for coloured stones

## Birefringence (Double Refraction)

The difference between highest and lowest RI values.

### Birefringence Values

| Gemstone | Birefringence | Visibility |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Zircon | 0.059 | Very strong - visible doubling |
| Peridot | 0.036 | Strong - visible doubling |
| Sphene | 0.100-0.135 | Extreme - obvious doubling |
| Tourmaline | 0.018-0.040 | Moderate |
| Corundum | 0.008 | Weak |
| Beryl | 0.005-0.009 | Weak |
| Quartz | 0.009 | Weak |
| Topaz | 0.008-0.010 | Weak |
| Spinel | None | Isotropic |
| Garnet | None | Isotropic |

**Doubling of back facets**: Observable in stones with birefringence > 0.020 when viewed through table facet.

### Optic Character

**Uniaxial minerals** (tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal):
- One optic axis
- Two RI values (ordinary and extraordinary)
- Uniaxial positive: extraordinary > ordinary
- Uniaxial negative: ordinary > extraordinary

**Biaxial minerals** (orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic):
- Two optic axes
- Three RI values (alpha, beta, gamma)
- Biaxial positive or negative

**Isotropic minerals** (cubic):
- No double refraction
- Single RI value

## Pleochroism

Different colours visible along different crystal axes in doubly refractive stones.

### Dichroism (Uniaxial Stones)

Two colours visible. Use a **dichroscope** to observe.

| Gemstone | Colours | Strength |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Ruby | Purplish-red / Orangey-red | Strong |
| Blue Sapphire | Violetish-blue / Greenish-blue | Strong |
| Padparadscha | Orange / Pink | Moderate |
| Tanzanite | Blue / Purple / Red-violet | Very strong (trichroic) |
| Tourmaline | Varies by colour | Strong to very strong |
| Aquamarine | Near-colourless / Blue | Weak to moderate |
| Emerald | Yellowish-green / Bluish-green | Moderate |

### Trichroism (Biaxial Stones)

Three colours visible along three axes.

| Gemstone | Colours | Strength |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Tanzanite | Blue / Purple / Burgundy | Very strong |
| Iolite | Blue / Grey / Yellowish | Very strong |
| Kunzite | Pink / Colourless / Violet | Strong |
| Andalusite | Yellow-green / Brown / Red | Strong |
| Alexandrite | Red-orange / Yellow-green / Green | Moderate |

**No pleochroism**: Isotropic stones (spinel, garnet) show no pleochroism.

## Dispersion (Fire)

The separation of white light into spectral colours.

### Dispersion Values

| Gemstone | Dispersion | Visibility |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Sphene | 0.051 | Exceptional |
| Demantoid | 0.057 | Exceptional |
| Sphalerite | 0.156 | Extreme (soft stone) |
| Zircon | 0.039 | High |
| Diamond | 0.044 | High (reference) |
| Spinel | 0.020 | Moderate |
| Corundum | 0.018 | Low |
| Beryl | 0.014 | Low |
| Quartz | 0.013 | Low |

**Factors affecting visible fire**:
- Cut quality and proportions
- Body colour (dark colours mask fire)
- Clarity (inclusions scatter light)
- Size (larger stones show more fire)

## Fluorescence

Emission of visible light under UV radiation.

### UV Testing

Use both **long-wave (365nm)** and **short-wave (254nm)** UV lamps.

| Gemstone | Long-wave UV | Short-wave UV |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Ruby (natural) | Strong red | Moderate to weak red |
| Ruby (synthetic) | Very strong red | Strong red |
| Burmese Ruby | Strong red | Strong red |
| Thai/African Ruby | Weak to none | Weak to none |
| Blue Sapphire | Usually inert | Usually inert |
| Yellow Sapphire | Apricot orange | Yellow |
| Emerald | Usually inert | Usually inert |
| Colombian Emerald | Weak red | Very weak |
| Kunzite | Strong orange-pink | Strong orange-pink |
| Spinel (red) | Moderate red | Weak to moderate |
| Spodumene | Phosphorescence common | Variable |
| Opal | Variable | Variable |

**Diagnostic uses**:
- Distinguish Burmese from Thai rubies
- Detect some synthetic materials
- Identify some treatments (filling, coating)

## Absorption Spectrum

Characteristic patterns of light absorption observed with a spectroscope.

### Key Diagnostic Spectra

**Ruby/Red Spinel**:
- Ruby: Strong lines at 694.2, 692.8nm (chromium doublet)
- Red Spinel: Organ-pipe spectrum in red, broad band ~540nm

**Emerald**:
- Chromium lines at 683, 680nm (doublet)
- Broad absorption in yellow-red

**Blue Sapphire**:
- Iron bands at 450, 460, 470nm (three-band pattern)
- Synthetic: Generally cleaner spectrum

**Zircon**:
- Complex uranium spectrum with multiple fine lines
- Particularly strong at 653.5nm

**Almandine Garnet**:
- Strong bands at 505, 520, 573nm (iron absorption)
- Very diagnostic
