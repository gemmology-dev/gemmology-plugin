# Fluorescence Reference Guide

UV fluorescence reactions for coloured gemstones under long-wave (LW, 365nm) and short-wave (SW, 254nm) ultraviolet light.

## Fluorescence Intensity Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Inert | No reaction |
| Weak | Barely visible |
| Moderate | Clearly visible |
| Strong | Obvious, bright |
| Very strong | Intense, may phosphoresce |

| Synthetic indicators | Generally | Often stronger/different |

### Origin Determination

| Comparison | High Fe (weak) | Low Fe (strong) |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Ruby origin | Thai/African | Burmese |

### Treatment Detection

- Chalky fluorescence zones may indicate heat treatment
- Filled areas may fluoresce differently
- UV can reveal coatings and fillings

## Testing Notes

1. **Dark room essential** for accurate observation
2. **Test both LW and SW** - reactions often differ
3. **Note intensity and colour** accurately
4. **Check for phosphorescence** after light off
5. **Safety**: Avoid direct eye exposure, especially SW
6. **Clean stones** before testing (oils can fluoresce)
