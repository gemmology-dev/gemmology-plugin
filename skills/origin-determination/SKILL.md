# Origin Determination

Guidance on identifying the geographic origin of coloured gemstones and understanding the impact of origin on value. Based on inclusion analysis, trace element chemistry, and other diagnostic features.

## Why Origin Matters

### Value Impact

| Gemstone | Premium Origin | Premium (approx.) |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Ruby | Burma (Myanmar) | 50-300%+ |
| Blue Sapphire | Kashmir | 100-500%+ |
| Blue Sapphire | Burma, Ceylon | 20-100% |
| Emerald | Colombian | 30-100% |
| Padparadscha | Sri Lanka (original) | Required for name |

### Origin Certification

Major laboratories providing origin reports:
- **Gübelin** (Switzerland)
- **SSEF** (Switzerland)
- **GIA** (USA)
- **Gem-A** (UK)
- **Lotus Gemology** (Thailand)
- **GRS** (Switzerland)

**Note**: Origin determination is an opinion, not absolute fact. Laboratories may differ.

## Ruby Origins

### Burma (Myanmar)

**Classic source**: Mogok Valley ("Valley of Rubies")

| Feature | Mogok Ruby |
|---------|------------|
| Colour | "Pigeon blood" red, strong fluorescence |
| Silk | Short, fine rutile needles |
| Inclusions | Calcite, apatite, rutile |
| Chemistry | High Cr, low Fe (strong fluorescence) |
| Fluorescence | Strong red under LW UV |

**Mong Hsu**: Secondary Burmese source
- Often purple core, red rim
- Requires heat treatment typically
- Lower value than Mogok

### Mozambique

Now a major producer of fine rubies.

## Sapphire Origins

### Kashmir

**The legendary origin** - production largely exhausted.

| Silk | Extremely fine, creates "sleepy" look |
| Inclusions | Tourmaline, pargasite, zircon |
| Chemistry | Low Fe/Ti ratio |
| Appearance | Soft, velvety due to silk |

**Authentication challenges**: Very few new stones; many fakes claimed as Kashmir.

### Burma (Myanmar)

| Silk | Rutile needles |
| Inclusions | Calcite, apatite, zircon |
| Fluorescence | Inert to weak |

### Sri Lanka (Ceylon)

| Feature | Ceylon Sapphire |
|---------|-----------------|
| Colour | Medium to light blue, highly brilliant |
| Silk | Rutile silk, often sparse |
| Inclusions | Zircon haloes, fingerprints |
| Chemistry | Moderate Fe/Ti |
| Fluorescence | Usually inert |

**Padparadscha**: Originally only from Sri Lanka
- Pinkish-orange to orangey-pink
- Name requires Sri Lankan origin (debated)

### Madagascar

Major modern source with wide colour range.

| Feature | Madagascar Sapphire |
|---------|---------------------|
| Colour | Full range available |
| Inclusions | Zircon, growth tubes, negative crystals |
| Chemistry | Variable |
| Note | Some rival finest Ceylon/Burma |

### Australia

| Feature | Australian Sapphire |
|---------|---------------------|
| Colour | Very dark blue, often greenish |
| Inclusions | Strong colour zoning |
| Chemistry | Very high iron |
| Value | Generally lower due to dark colour |

### Montana (USA)

| Feature | Montana Sapphire |
|---------|------------------|
| Colour | Blue-green, teal, unusual colours |
| Inclusions | Distinctive suite |
| Appeal | Unique colours, ethical sourcing |

### Thailand/Cambodia (Chanthaburi)

| Feature | Thai Sapphire |
|---------|---------------|
| Colour | Dark blue to blackish |
| Chemistry | Very high iron |
| Use | Often heated to improve colour |

## Emerald Origins

### Colombia

**The classic source** - defines top emerald colour.

| Feature | Colombian Emerald |
|---------|-------------------|
| Colour | Pure green, "gota de aceite" |
| Inclusions | Three-phase, pyrite, jagged cavities |
| Chemistry | Cr-dominant, low Fe |
| Appearance | Higher transparency typically |

**Major mines**: Muzo, Chivor, Coscuez (each with subtle differences)

### Zambia

Second major source, gaining acceptance.

| Feature | Zambian Emerald |
|---------|-----------------|
| Colour | Slightly bluish-green |
| Inclusions | Two-phase, actinolite, mica |
| Chemistry | Higher Fe, V significant |
| Appearance | Good transparency available |

### Brazil

## Other Gemstone Origins

### Alexandrite

| Origin | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|

| Brazil | Good colour change, significant production |
| Sri Lanka | Often more khaki/brown colours |
| Tanzania | Variable quality |
| India | Variable, newer source |

### Spinel

| Origin | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Burma (Mogok) | Finest red and pink spinels |
| Tajikistan (Kuh-i-Lal) | Historical "Balas rubies" |
| Tanzania (Mahenge) | Vivid pink/red, recent |

| Vietnam | Good quality red/pink |

### Paraiba Tourmaline

| Origin | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Brazil (Paraíba state) | Original source, electric "neon" blue-green, highest value |
| Brazil (Rio Grande do Norte) | Similar to original Paraíba, often larger stones |
| Nigeria | Copper-bearing, variable saturation, often lighter or greener |
| Mozambique | Copper-bearing, lighter saturation, good commercial material |

**Nigerian Paraiba characteristics**:
- Discovered early 2000s
- Copper + manganese bearing elbaite
- Often lighter saturation than Brazilian
- Can show green to blue-green colours
- Some material rivals Brazilian in appearance
- More affordable than Brazilian origin
- Requires certification for value

**Origin determination requirements**:
- **LA-ICP-MS essential** for copper-bearing tourmaline origin
- Trace element fingerprinting: Cu, Mn, Ga, Pb isotopes
- Brazilian material: distinct Cu/Mn ratios
- African sources overlap in some trace elements
- Visual examination insufficient for origin

**Note**: "Paraíba-type" or "Paraíba tourmaline" refers to copper-bearing elbaite from any source. Geographic origin (Brazil, Nigeria, Mozambique) must be specified and significantly affects value.

### Tanzanite

- **Only source**: Merelani Hills, Tanzania
- Origin determination: Not applicable (single source)

## Origin Determination Methods

### Visual/Microscopic

| Method | Information Gained |
|--------|-------------------|
| Inclusion analysis | Mineral assemblage indicates origin |
| Growth patterns | Formation environment |
| Colour zoning | Growth history |

### Chemical Analysis

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **LA-ICP-MS** | Trace element fingerprinting |
| **EDXRF** | Non-destructive elemental analysis |
| **LIBS** | Surface element analysis |

### Spectroscopic

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| UV-Vis-NIR | Colour-causing elements |
| FTIR | Treatment detection |
| Raman | Inclusion identification |

## Challenges in Origin Determination

### Overlapping Characteristics

Some origins share similar features:
- Kashmir vs Burma sapphire (both can have fine silk)
- Colombian vs Afghan emerald (both have three-phase)
- Multiple ruby sources with similar inclusions

### Mixed Parcels

Gems from different origins in same rough lot.

### Treated Stones

Heat treatment can destroy/alter origin indicators.

### Laboratory Disagreement

Different labs may reach different conclusions.
