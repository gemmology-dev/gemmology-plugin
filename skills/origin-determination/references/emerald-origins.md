| **Hydrothermal (sedimentary)** | Colombia | Low Fe, three-phase inclusions |
| **Schist-hosted (metamorphic)** | Zambia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Russia | Higher Fe, amphibole/mica |
| **Pegmatite-related** | Some Brazil | Variable |

### Key Differentiators

| Origin | Fe Content | Key Inclusions | Colour Tendency |
|--------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Colombia | Very low | Three-phase, pyrite | Warm green, yellow |
| Zambia | High | Actinolite, mica | Cool green, bluish |
| Mozambique | Moderate-high | Biotite, amphibole, two-phase | Cool green |
| Brazil | Moderate-high | Biotite | Variable |
| Afghanistan | Low-moderate | Two-phase | Variable |
| Ethiopia | Moderate | Black crystals, tubes | Variable |

### Testing Approach

1. **Visual assessment** - Colour, tone, saturation
2. **Microscopy** - Inclusion study (critical)
3. **Spectroscopy** - Chromium vs vanadium
4. **Advanced analysis** - LA-ICP-MS (Fe, Cs, V, Cr)
5. **Fluorescence** - Usually inert (Fe quenches)

## Treatment Considerations

### Oil/Resin Treatment

| Treatment | Prevalence | Detection |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **None** | Rare for Colombian | Premium value |
| **Minor** | Common | Accepted |
| **Moderate** | Very common | Standard disclosure |
| **Significant** | Common | Value impact |

**Detection methods**:
- UV fluorescence (some fillers fluoresce)
- Microscopy (flash effect, sweating)
- FTIR spectroscopy (filler identification)

### Treatment Prevalence by Origin

| Origin | Treatment Rate | Typical Enhancement |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Colombia | Very high (90%+) | Oil, resin common |
| Zambia | Lower | Often cleaner |
| Mozambique | Moderate-high | Oil common |
| Brazil | High | Oil common |
| Afghanistan | Moderate | Variable |

## Value Hierarchy

| Origin | Premium Level | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Colombia (Muzo) | Highest | Exceptional colour |
| Colombia (Chivor) | Very high | Slightly cooler |
| Zambia (fine) | High | Undervalued |
| Mozambique (fine) | Moderate-high | Growing reputation |
| Brazil (fine) | Moderate | Variable |
| Afghanistan (fine) | Moderate | Underappreciated |
| Ethiopia | Moderate | Emerging |
| Other | Variable | Quality-dependent |
