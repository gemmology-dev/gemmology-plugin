# Sapphire Geographic Origins

Comprehensive guide to sapphire sources and their characteristics.

## Blue Sapphire Origins

### Kashmir

**Status**: Historic legendary source, virtually exhausted
**Geological setting**: Pegmatite in metamorphic rocks
**Mining period**: 1881-1930s (main production)

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Colour** | "Cornflower blue", velvety |
| **Texture** | Sleepy, velvety appearance |
| **Cause of velvet** | Microscopic inclusions scatter light |
| **Fluorescence** | Inert (very low iron) |
| **Key inclusions** | Tourmaline, pargasite, zircon |
| **Iron content** | Extremely low |

**Diagnostic features**:
- Soft, milky appearance without loss of saturation
- Colour seems to "glow from within"
- Tourmaline + pargasite = very diagnostic
- Graduated colour zoning

**Market significance**:
- Highest premiums of any sapphire
- Exceptional pieces reach record auction prices
- New material extremely rare
- Certificate from major lab essential
- Beware of misattributed material

### Myanmar (Burma)

**Status**: Historic prestigious source
**Geological setting**: Marble contact zone (Mogok)

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Colour** | Rich royal blue, may have purple tint |
| **Tone** | Medium to medium-dark |
| **Fluorescence** | Variable, usually weak |
| **Key inclusions** | Rutile silk, calcite, apatite |
| **Iron content** | Low to moderate |

**Diagnostic features**:
- Often shows distinct colour zoning
- Fine rutile silk common
- Calcite inclusions (marble-hosted)
- Can resemble Kashmir (but different inclusions)

**Market significance**:
- Second highest premiums after Kashmir
- "Burma sapphire" commands respect
- Unheated premium significant

### Sri Lanka (Ceylon)

**Status**: Major historic and current producer
**Geological setting**: Alluvial (gem gravels)

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Colour** | Light to medium blue, often pastel |
| **Tone** | Generally lighter than Burma |
| **Fluorescence** | Variable |
| **Key inclusions** | Zircon with haloes, fingerprints, silk |
| **Gallium content** | Low (distinguishes from basaltic) |

**Colour varieties**:
- Classic "Ceylon blue" - pastel blue
- Darker stones approach Burma appearance
- Padparadscha from Sri Lanka especially valued

**Market significance**:
- Large production, consistent quality
- More affordable than Burma/Kashmir
- Excellent value proposition
- Padparadscha commands extreme premiums

| **Tone** | Very dark (common issue) |
| **Fluorescence** | Inert (very high iron) |
| **Key feature** | Dark colour bands |
| **Iron content** | Very high |

**Market significance**:
- Lower value due to dark colour
- Large production volume
- Used in commercial jewellery
- Heat treatment can improve

### Thailand/Cambodia

**Status**: Important producer (Chanthaburi area)
**Geological setting**: Basalt-hosted

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Colour** | Dark blue, may have green tinge |
| **Fluorescence** | Inert |
| **Iron content** | High |

**Market significance**:
- Significant production historically
- Treatment expected (heat)
- Commercial grades common
- Depleted deposits

### Montana (USA)

**Status**: Active producer (Yogo, Missouri River, Rock Creek)
**Geological setting**: Igneous (Yogo lamprophyre dyke), Alluvial (secondary deposits)

| Deposit | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Yogo Gulch** | Violet-blue, small (<1ct typically), fine quality, unheated |
| **Missouri River** | Various colours (blue, green, pink, yellow), larger, often heated |
| **Rock Creek** | Pastel colours, smaller, parti-coloured common |
| **Dry Cottonwood Creek** | Various, alluvial |
| **Gem Mountain** | Commercial mining operation, various colours |

**Colour characteristics**:
- Yogo: distinctive violet-blue, uniform colour, no zoning
- Secondary deposits: wide colour range including:
  - Blue (light to medium)
  - Green and teal
  - Yellow and golden
  - Pink and purple
  - "Parti-coloured" (multiple colours in one stone)

**Diagnostic inclusions**:
- Negative crystals (geometric voids)
- Tiny colourless crystals (possibly zircon)
- Colour zoning (in alluvial material)
- Healed fractures with fluid inclusions
- Generally clean compared to many origins

**Distinguishing features**:
- Yogo: remarkably uniform colour without zoning
- Moderate iron content (between metamorphic and basaltic)
- Distinctive trace element signature (Ga/Mg ratios)
- Often small sizes (Yogo rarely exceeds 1 carat)

**Market significance**:
- Yogo commands respect for natural colour (typically unheated)
- American origin marketing appeal ("Made in USA")
- Ethical/domestic sourcing narrative
- Growing collector interest
- Generally smaller sizes limit use in larger jewellery
- Heat treatment common for secondary deposit material

## Origin Determination

### Key Differentiators

| Origin | Fe Content | Ga Content | Inclusions |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Kashmir | Very low | Very low | Tourmaline, pargasite |
| Burma | Low | Low-mod | Silk, calcite |
| Sri Lanka | Low-mod | Low | Zircon haloes, fingerprints |
| Madagascar | Variable | Variable | Locality-specific |
| Basaltic (Thai/Aus) | Very high | High | Sparse, bands |
| Montana | Moderate | Moderate | Distinctive ratios |

### Testing Approach

1. **Visual assessment** - Colour, tone, zoning
2. **UV fluorescence** - Fe content indicator
3. **Microscopy** - Inclusion examination
4. **Spectroscopy** - 450nm band (Fe)
5. **Advanced analysis** - LA-ICP-MS (Fe, Ti, Ga, Mg)

## Value Hierarchy

| Origin | Blue Premium | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Kashmir | Highest | "Cornflower", velvety |
| Burma | Very high | Royal blue, unheated premium |
| Sri Lanka (fine) | High | Classic Ceylon, pastel |
| Madagascar (fine) | Moderate-high | Undervalued |
| Montana (Yogo) | Moderate | Natural colour appeal |
| Thai/Australian | Lower | Dark colour |
