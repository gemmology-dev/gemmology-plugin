# Origin Premiums Guide

Market value adjustments based on geographic origin.

## Understanding Origin Premiums

### Why Origin Affects Value

1. **Historic reputation** - Traditional prestige sources
2. **Rarity** - Depleted or limited deposits
3. **Quality association** - Origin correlates with characteristics
4. **Marketing** - Brand value of origin names
5. **Collector demand** - Preference for specific sources
6. **Traceable provenance** - Ethical sourcing

### Premium Calculation

Origin premium = (Origin-attributed price) ÷ (Generic price for same quality) × 100

Example: A 5ct Burma ruby sells for $50,000/ct vs $30,000/ct for equivalent Mozambique
Premium = 50,000 ÷ 30,000 = 167% (or +67%)

## Market Realities

### Origin Premium Limitations

1. **Quality still paramount** - Low-quality Burma < fine Mozambique
2. **Treatment matters more** - Treated Burma < untreated Mozambique
3. **Certificate essential** - Claims without proof = no premium
4. **Market education** - Some buyers accept new origins
5. **Changing preferences** - Mozambique acceptance growing

### Investment Considerations

| Origin Type | Investment Quality |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Kashmir sapphire | Strong historical performer |
| Burma ruby (fine) | Consistent premium |
| Colombia emerald | Established market |
| New origins | Variable, growing |

### Realistic Expectations

- Origin premium only applies to fine quality
- Commercial goods see minimal origin impact
- Treatment status often more important than origin
- Market can be irrational about origin
- Laboratory consensus essential for realising premium
